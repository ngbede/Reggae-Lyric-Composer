oh where have you been my blueeyed son
and where have you been my darling young one
ive stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
ive walked and ive crawled on six crooked highways
ive stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
ive been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
ive been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
and its a hard its a hard its a hard and its a hard
its a hard rains agonna fall
oh what did you see my blue eyed son
and what did you see my darling young one
i saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
i saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
i saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin
i saw a room full of men with their hammers ableedin
i saw a white ladder all covered with water
i saw ten thousand takers whose tongues were all broken
i saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
and its a hard its a hard its a hard and its a hard
its a hard rains agonna fall
and what did you hear my blueeyed son
and what did you hear my darling young one
i heard the sound of a thunder it roared out a warnin
i heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
i heard one hundred drummers whose hands were ablazin
i heard ten thousand whisperin and nobody listenin
i heard one person starve i heard many people laughin
heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
and its a hard its a hard its a hard its a hard
and its a hard rains agonna fall
oh who did you meet my blueeyed son
who did you meet my darling young one
i met a young child beside a dead pony
i met a white man who walked a black dog
i met a young woman whose body was burning
i met a young girl she gave me a rainbow
i met one man who was wounded in love
i met another man who was wounded and hatred
and its a hard its a hard its a hard its a hard
and its a hard rains agonna fall
and whatll you do now my blueeyed son
and whatll you do now my darling young one
im agoin back out fore the rain starts afallin
ill walk to the deepths of the deepest black forest
where the people are a many and their hands are all empty
where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
where the executioners face is always well hidden
where hunger is ugly where souls are forgotten
where black is the color where none is the number
and ill tell and think it and speak it and breathe it
and reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it
then ill stand on the ocean until i start sinkin
but ill know my songs well before i start singin
and its a hard its a hard its a hard and its a hard
its a hard rains agonna fall

from where i stand
i can see the world
getting smaller and smaller
and therell be no place
for people like you georgie
who still live in the past
when you couldnt do things
for yourself you blamed it on apartheid
you blamed it on the government and everybody
now is the time to prove yourself
if you think affirmative action
is the way out no way no way
constitution can be changed
from time to time
but that does not mean that
you dont need no education
we are tired of people who
think that affirmative action is the way out
and is another way of putting puppets
where they dont belong
im so sorry georgie
but the only way to get our economy
strong is to have
an educated nation
and if you think affirmative action

oh autumn seems to never end
the leaves are always brown
summer seems to never tend
to ever come around
spring times are for beginnings
when true love is found
winters are for finishings
true love stands its grounds
now i hear no happy songs
birds have all gone south
bright green pastures drying up
and plenty turn to drought
life is full of ups and downs
the carousels of love
good times bad times smiles and frowns
dont give up on me
dont give up on me
time flies by while having fun
its all gone in a wink
and now the days feel more like much
dont know what to think

old man sitting by the side of the road
hes not watching the birds today
hes not watching the sunset like he always does
hes looking at the future
he has seen the past
school boy passes by interrupts his thoughts
he said sir can you spare me a dollar
i got to make in time for my grade 8 class
i am fresh out of cigarettes
and i cant be late
the old man said
chorus
the world is changing
take your time look around
make the right decision
he has no crystal ball
but he sees the future
doesnt like what he sees but what can he do
little girl passes by with a baby in her arms
he thinks its her mothers
but no it is her own
shes only twelve years old for crying out loud
with his trembling finger
he wipes away the tears
if this is the future he doesnt wanna be part of it
chorus
the world is changing
take a time look around
make the right decision
old man sitting by the side of his bed
when he goes to sleep tonight
he wont have no sweet dreams
hell be haunted by ghosts from the future
welcome to the future

oh where have you been my blueeyed son
and where have you been my darling young one
ive stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
ive walked and ive crawled on six crooked highways
ive stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
ive been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
ive been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
and its a hard its a hard its a hard and its a hard
its a hard rains agonna fall
oh what did you see my blue eyed son
and what did you see my darling young one

i saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
i saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin
i saw a room full of men with their hammers ableedin
i saw a white ladder all covered with water
i saw ten thousand takers whose tongues were all broken
i saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
and its a hard its a hard its a hard and its a hard
its a hard rains agonna fall
and what did you hear my blueeyed son
and what did you hear my darling young one
i heard the sound of a thunder it roared out a warnin
i heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
i heard one hundred drummers whose hands were ablazin
i heard ten thousand whisperin and nobody listenin
i heard one person starve i heard many people laughin
heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
and its a hard its a hard its a hard its a hard
and its a hard rains agonna fall
oh who did you meet my blueeyed son
who did you meet my darling young one
i met a young child beside a dead pony
i met a white man who walked a black dog
i met a young woman whose body was burning
i met a young girl she gave me a rainbow
i met one man who was wounded in love
i met another man who was wounded and hatred
and its a hard its a hard its a hard its a hard
and its a hard rains agonna fall
and whatll you do now my blueeyed son
and whatll you do now my darling young one
im agoin back out fore the rain starts afallin
ill walk to the deepths of the deepest black forest
where the people are a many and their hands are all empty
where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
where the executioners face is always well hidden
where hunger is ugly where souls are forgotten
where black is the color where none is the number
and ill tell and think it and speak it and breathe it
and reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it
then ill stand on the ocean until i start sinkin
but ill know my songs well before i start singin
and its a hard its a hard its a hard and its a hard
its a hard rains agonna fall

you blamed it on the government and everybody
now is the time to prove yourself
if you think affirmative action
is the way out no way no way
constitution can be changed
from time to time
but that does not mean that
you dont need no education
we are tired of people who
think that affirmative action is the way out
and is another way of putting puppets
where they dont belong
im so sorry georgie
but the only way to get our economy
strong is to have
an educated nation
and if you think affirmative action
is the way out no way no way
chorus
education is still the key
even though we have affirmative action
chorus till fade

hes not watching the sunset like he always does
hes looking at the future

he thinks its her mothers
but no it is her own
shes only twelve years old for crying out loud
with his trembling finger
he wipes away the tears
if this is the future he doesnt wanna be part of it
chorus

before they told her what she was always afraid of

one day it was three in the morning
the guard came running to tell us shes gone
blue lights flashing everywhere

and left me standing here

trampled on my pride
but ill hold my head up high
got no more tears to cry
going back west

over hills and valleys
they are everywhere to be found
but though we bear our burdens now
all afflictions got to end somehow
from swinging the hammer pulling the plough
why wont you let us be to live in harmony
we like to be free like birds in a tree

they wake up in the morning and wish you were there
dont have to lie to gain their trust
you have never won a nobel prize
they have never seen you on the tv
your little contribution makes their lives a little bit better every day
chorus
youre a hero youre a hero

verse 1 stephen marley
ive been gone a while away from you when i hope you overstand
that ive got to do what i must do to be a better man
cause if i was just to act a fool do nothing with myself
then all my blessings would be cursed my world would crumble in
its a joy when i sit down and think of the good times that we had
and what we do to make it through when the good turns to the bad
well i hope youll find it in your heart to know these words are true
and please dont fuss because i must go do what i must do
chorus stephen marley
hey baby dont you worry even though the road is rocky
ill be coming home to you again
if you thought that i was lost
i had to bear my cross
now im free from all these chains
verse 2 stephen marley
a time a space a different place how perfect we might be
i would be the wind that blows youd be that willow tree
and i could never bear the thought of you not by my side
so i would be the warmth of day youd be the cool of night
and everyday i pray to jah that one day you will see
and overstand the fact i must fulfill my destiny
i hope you find it in your heart and know these words are true
and please dont cry â€“ you know that i must do what i must do
chorus stephen marley
hey baby dont you worry even though the road is rocky
ill be coming home to you again

well then its not easy
jah knows how i try i try
so dont you get weary oh god
jah knows how i try i try
verse 3 mos def
and god knows that life is one big road
with a lot of signs and turns and twist and curves
even though the road is rocky
but maintain the ride and keep on rocking
from city to city backyard to yard
and we be seeing the sights and standing under the lights
and the spot is hot its cold and lonely at nights
and im feenin and im dreaming and im holding you tight
but hold on every single road i rode on
comes to an end and im back home again
so baby please dont cry
its no valley low and its no mountain high
and our love dont die with the passage of time
it just grow more it just keep strong
and even though im gone i aint moving too far
youre the light through the dark shining right through my heart
so my journey just start
chorus stephen marley
hey baby dont you worry even though the road is rocky
ill be coming home to you again

freedom fighter standing on a mountain
in a foreign country
trying to send a message
to his people back in the ghetto
he had a home one time
love of a girl
but he left all that behind
oh yes i can hear him clearly as he whispers in the air
his voice came out loud and clear
all he asked for was a prayer and as he turns to walk away he said
chorus
im still here in the house of exile
for the love of the nation
sun went down on the mountain
birds flew back to their hiding places
leaving him standing there like a telephone pole
in the still of the night
you and i dream
dreaming of romeo  juliet
all he dreams about is the freedom of the nation
when every man will be equal in the eyes of the law
as he closes his eyes
for the last time he said again
chorus till fade

im sorry but i dont want to be an emperor
thats not my business i dont want to rule or conquer anyone
i should like to help everyone if possible jew gentile black man white
we all want to help one another human beings are like that
we want to live by each others happiness not by each others misery
we dont want to hate and despise one another
in this world there is room for everyone
and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone
the way of life can be free and beautiful but we have lost the way
greed has poisoned mens souls has barricaded the world with hate has goosestepped us into misery and bloodshed
we have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in
machinery that gives abundance has left us in want
our knowledge has made us cynical our cleverness hard and unkind
we think too much and feel too little more than machinery we need humanity
more than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness
without these qualities life will be violent and all will be lost
the aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together
the very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men
cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all
even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world millions of despairing men women and little children
victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people
to those who can hear me i say do not despair
the misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress

i pray thee
why do the heathen rage and the people imagine of such vain things
false kings of the earth hath set themselves and the rulers take counsel together
against the lord god jah rastafari and against his anointed saying
now come let us break their bands asunder and cast away their cords from us
he that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh
the lord god jah rastafari shall have them in derision
but then shall he speak unto them in his wrath
and vex with them in his sore displeasure
cah i have set my king upon my holy hill of zion
i will now declare the decree
the lord god jah rastafari hath said unto i and i and i
that thou art my son this day have i begotten thee
now ask of i and i and i and i shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance
and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession
jah shalt break them with a rod of iron
jah shalt dash them in pieces like a potters vessel as i would say
so be wise now therefore o ye kings be instructed judges of the earth
serve the lord god jah rastafari with fear and rejoice with trembling
cause i and i the son lest he be angry
but purge from his ways when his wrath is kindled but a little
and so blessed be all blessed be everyone as i would say
blessed be everyone as i would tell you

not all that glitter is gold once a fool was told
right before he sold his soul his soul
and a man made his money his money was on his mind
he got everything he wanted and he still wasnt satisfied
how you feel when you look in the mirror do you see a champion or a weakling
whats your thing what you chasing falsehood or fatherhood
abandonment of parenthood im looking for something good
theres something bout the way you act the way you play the game
i love you smile and you dont look at life quite the same
your attitude kinda make me want to really change
look at things not the same but differently

shes coming in from the cold she cant stand to be alone
hes looking for a hole what she needs is a home
hope you find what you need hope you find what you need
a religious man is preaching said he found god
but he couldnt go to heaven until he found love
the people they are listening he caught them by surprise
he confessed all his sins and he stop telling lies
i hear you wanna try to find it do you know what it is
i hear you go looking for what you want i hope you find what you need
i hear you gonna try to find it do you know what it is
i hear you go looking for what you want hope you find what you need
hope you find what you need
hey yo push come to shove what happen to the love
what happen to the giving instead of taking my heart is breaking
to many greedy not giving to the needy
what happen to the pity when you walk through the inner city
now where the love at where the hugs at
nowadays everybody want to be a thug act
too many materialistic ways and nowadays nobody love each other the same way
everyones trying to find it do we know what it is
hear we go looking for what we want i hope we find what we need
everyones trying to find it do we know what it is
i hear we go looking for what we want i hope we find what we need

i said i am a lion but you never heard me roar
i am a hero that nobody celebrates
but if one person remembers my name that means i made a change
im the man who cooks the food and feed the street people in the afternoon
im the lady with the broom sweeping the halls of your sons preschool
im the soldier whos up all night making sure everythings alright
and if you ask me im quite fine being a ordinary person doing whats right
yesterday at the football game
a little girl asked me my name
she said sir ive seen you before tell me who are you
said i am a legend that you never heard of before
said i am a lion but you never heard me roar
i am a hero that nobody celebrates
but if one person remembers my name that means
im the ocean of fame
im an unknown sailor
im the percussionist playing with the wailers
the one with the shaker the mover and shaker
my name wasnt on the front of the paper
but mi nuh care cah
much more than the work cah the work is greater
creation glorifies creator
so all deeds done are in the name of my maker
i am a legend that you probably never hear about
words from the lions mouth
i am a hero that nobody celebrates
but if one person remembers my name
give praise that means i made a change
legend legend
i am a legend
story of my life
ordinary person just like you
if you take a look inside
youll see the great things that people do
we out here changing lives day and night day in day out
bbc dont show it
cnn dont show it
ease out

ive learned some lessons in my life
always be careful of mankind
theyll make you promises today
but tomorrow they change their mind
but im an upfull man
and i love upfull people
im a progressive man
and i love progressive people
im a truthful man
and i love truthful people
im an honest man
and i love honest people
ive learned some lessons in my life
always be careful of my friends
money can make friendship end
but im an upfull man
and i love upfull people
im a progressive man
and i love progressive people
im an honest man
i love honest people
im an intelligent man
and i love intelligent people
im an aggressive man
and i love aggressive people
im a fire man
and i love the fire people
but im an upfull man
and i love upfull people
im an intelligent man
and i love intelligent people
im a progressive man
and i love progressive people

even though his times are hard
you can hardly see it on his face
because of the smile
people coming in from miles away
to hear him sing and see him play

life in the movies
where the good guys always
win in the end

to serve and protect
the community if they themselves
are the bad guys
police have joined forces with criminals

and she hurries down to meet me and im always late
but she sits waitin patiently
and smiles when she first sees me

theres a lot of things
to be legalized yeah
but abortion is not an
important thing here
how can you have a face
of an angel
and let the devil inside of you
take control

little voices crying out
from far away saying
chorus

the world can save the children

man and woman seem to certainly have lost their way
our little hearts are full of hatred
now it appears that were way in over our heads
and were in dire need of help
cause theres no way that we can right all these wrongs by ourselves
the angel only said
man looks are deceiving you
now dont you underrate yourselves
oh looks are deceiving you
now dont you underrate yourselves no
oh looks are deceiving mankind
so feel good about yourself
oh looks are deceiving mankind
oh always be proud of yourself
then i said angel the people are consumed by sin
and we no longer love his laws
a generation thats all but forgotten bout him
rebels without a cause
the angel told me the judgement we face is real
only if we choose to believe it
jah love us all too much to ever let us burn in hell
they had to keep that one a secret
oh looks are deceiving you
now dont you underrate yourselves no
oh looks are deceiving mankind
feel good about
oh looks are deceiving you

oh looks are deceiving you

standing alone in the middle of the city
man looks around him
he hardly recognises what he sees
cause hes a man from the past
two thousand years ago
this was his home
rivers used to run here
birds used to fly around here
but now it is a different jungle
a concrete jungle
chorus
hes a lonely man
in the middle of the city
missing home so badly
mans own creation
has become his worst enemy
weaplons of destruction
have brought about
human extinction wo ho
two thousand years ago
this was his home
but now it is
a different jungle
a concrete jungle
chorus
hes a lonely man
in the middle of the city
missing home so badly

to be living in a world where little children
dont have to die because their parents are poor
when we came to this world
we were prepared to fight a battle
but we found a war
when we came to this world
we were prepared to fight demons
but we found the devil himself

the obstacles that we must climb
adversity is my ally
even though she makes me cry

from charlie chaplins famous barber speech in the great dictator
im sorry but i dont want to be an emperor thats not my business
i dont want to rule or conquer anyone
i should like to help everyone if possible jew gentile black man white
we all want to help one another human beings are like that
we want to live by each others happiness not by each others misery
we dont want to hate and despise one another
in this world there is room for everyone
and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone
the way of life can be free and beautiful but we have lost the way
greed has poisoned mens souls has barricaded the world with hate
has goosestepped us into misery and bloodshed
we have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in
machinery that gives abundance has left us in want
our knowledge has made us cynical our cleverness hard and unkind
we think too much and feel too little
more than machinery we need humanity
more than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness
without these qualities life will be violent and all will be lost
the aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together
the very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men
cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all
even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world
millions of despairing men women and little children
victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people
to those who can hear me i say do not despair
the misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed
the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress
the hate of men will pass and dictators die
and the power they took from the people will return to the people
and so long as men die liberty will never perish
soldiers dont give yourselves to brutes men who despise you and enslave you
who regiment your lives tell you what to do what to think and what to feel
who drill you diet you treat you like cattle use you as cannon fodder
dont give yourselves to these unnatural men
machine men with machine minds and machine hearts
you are not machines you are not cattle you are men
you have the love of humanity in your hearts
you dont hate only the unloved hate the unloved and the unnatural
soldiers dont fight for slavery fight for liberty
in the seventeenth chapter of saint luke it is written
the kingdom of god is within man not one man nor a group of men
but in all men in you the people you the people have the power
the power to create machines the power to create happiness
you the people have the power to make life free and beautiful
to make this life a wonderful adventure
let us use that power let us all unite
let us fight for a new world a decent world
that will give men a chance to work
that will give you the future and old age and security
by the promise of these things brutes have risen to power
but they lie they do not fulfil their promise they never will
dictators free themselves but they enslave the people
now let us fight to fulfil that promise let us fight to free the world
to do away with national barriers do away with greed with hate and intolerance
let us fight for a world of reason a world where science and progress will lead to all mens happiness
soldiers let us all unite

verse

and a incense herbs and oils
scrapbook newspaper
clippings and files
a view of di countryside
remind me of nine miles
where di trees are green
and di people smile
after few water crackers
and some warm milo tea
rub massage home made
coco butter skin cream
interior design of
ights gold and green
and the vibes are pure
and the thoughts are clean
she collect her own
dividends weekly
so mi know ah no money
mek she seek me
cool me down
and tie mi knotty dem neatly
draw close
while whispering sweetly
mi teach her each and everytime
that she link me

true she roots and culture
she win me
i even had to
introduce her to cindy
chorus
verse mr cheeks
verse
well i was sitting
by an open fire place
in my flavorite dungarees
i play a few strums
upon my guitar
and it sounds so good to me
big skunky blunt a blaze
and plus
my flavorite stooks beside me
i glance over
just so i could see her
but my locks got in the way
cool breeze a blow
thru the weeping willow
she always leave
a fragrance on my pillow
when im ready
she will always follow
me to the place of
my old sleepy hollow
soft silky voice is
so sacred and hollow
cause out spoken noisy
streams run shallow
reach to the stars
when i launch the apollo
could a land up ah sao paulo
chorus

chorus stephen marley
pimpas paradise thats all she was now
pimpas paradise thats all she was
pimpas paradise thats all she was now
pimpas paradise thats all she was
verse 1
cause coke was a thing that once she first try
was once a blue moon to once a blue sky
now shes wondering who else wants to go buy
she dont got no money and wants to get high
story sounds familiar
like born to be wild but she sillier
not quite the same but she similar
a waste of my sarsaparilla
used to look good in the videos now she look hideous
now its broken crack pipes with lipstick traces
walks the cold nights red district places
she seen more hotels than my tour suitcases
more male customers than old navys
she love lime light more than john swabys
seen more miles than a rentaavis
she dont slow down then someday maybe
she lost and cant find her way to safety
chorus repeats
black thought
check it out
she keep her head up in the space like a satellite
because she got an insatiable appetite
for staying out late nights with all the parasites
plotting on a way to cop a little piece of paradise
her dignity the only thing that she could sacrifice
just get the monkey off her back and shed be back in line
five minutes she stay on the move
shed done smoked up the stone that the builder refused
all coked up alone she aint even in tune
and its sad cause she aint really have a reason to use
she was pretty girl
cleaner than the board of health
studied and enjoyed herself i dont know what drove her to avoid herself
destroyed herself and took a taste of the yay
and now she on the track working while she wasting away
its safe to say she looking for a someplace to stay
who ever got a little paper to play
can get a slice of this
chorus repeats
verse 2
for no reason a seasoned splif was the first thing
one spring season while shes out flirting
now she season in and dont need rehearsing
esteem get a beating life is uncertain
ego need feeding now the wants worsen
beneath the demons shes a warm person
when shes not fiending swearing and cursing
behind the curtains shes really hurting
and while her people dont even trust her at home
the dealer dem grin and cook the rocks down
and she without sin will spark the first stone
the feeling kicks in shes in the dark zone
old friends walk pass going bout their own
as if she is someone that they dont know
then the king of kings lift her off the floor
saying life is a thing when you learn you grow
chorus repeats
verse 3
she rise and she fall like a star
her life write off like a car
her face full of all kinda scar
always quick fi start a war
she cant keep herself up to par
she plays like a broken guitar
she always want tek it too far
i doubt she ago mek it too far
she rise and she fall like a star
her life write off like a car
her face full of all kinda scar
always quick fi start a war
she cant keep herself up to par
she plays like a broken guitar
she always want tek it too far
mi wonder how she mek it so far

please listen to me carefully
and if im wrong then correct me

poor slave
take the chains off your body
poor slave
put the chains on your mind
a tree is still a tree
though it shed its leaves when winter falls
but it blooms again in spring
because it did not lose its roots at all
but a slave
remains a slave
without the knowledge of its roots
until he thought his past
not just some but all the truths
poor slave
take the chains off your body
poor slave
put the chains on your mind
there was a brother the other day
telling me hes feeling high

is with knowledge and understanding

the vows she took
were a mere formality
but in her life
they became a reality
and by the look of things
shes fighting a losing battle

im havin daymares in daytime
wide awake try to relate
this cant be happenin like im in a dream while im walkin
cause what im seein is haunting
human beings like ghost and zombies
president mugabe holding guns to innocent bodies
in zimbabwe
they make john pope seem godly
sacrilegious and blasphemous
in my lifetime i look back at paths ive walked
where savages fought and pastors taught
prostitutes stomp in high heel boots
and badges screamingyoung black children stop or i will shoot
i look back at cooked crack
plus cars that pass by
jaguars mad fly
and im guilty for materialism
blacks is still up in the prison trust that
so save me your sorries im raising an army
revolutionary warfare with damian marley
we sparkin the ions marching to zion
you know how nas be nyc state of mind im in
verse 1 repeats
hook
i got to keep on walking on the road to zion man
we gots to keeps it burning on the road to zion man
clean and pure meditation without a doubt
dont mek dem take you like who dem took out
jah will be waiting there we a shout
jah will be waiting there
chorus 2
clean and pure meditation without a doubt
dont mek dem take you like who dem took out
jah will be waiting there we a shout
jah will be waiting there
in this world of calamity
dirty looks and grudges and jealousy
and police weh abuse dem authority
media clowns weh nuh know bout variety
single parents weh need some charity
youths weh need some love and prosperity
instead of broken dreams and tragedy
by any plan and any means and strategy
instead of broken dreams and tragedy
youths weh need some love and prosperity
instead of broken dreams and tragedy
by any plan and any means and any strategy
ay say
hook
i got to keep on walking on the road to zion man

we got to keep on walking on the road to zion man

i take the roads less travelled im on my way
i take the roads less travelled ill see you again some day
i take the roads less travelled well im on my way
when i was a young boy people try to tell me what i should be
and then a wise man sang decide your own destiny
aunty said choices you make chances you take
to be free to be free to be free i got to be brave
i take the roads less travelled im on my way
i take the roads less travelled ill see you some day
now my daddy had a lot of women and my mama had a lot of grief
and the brethrens that surrounded him became the enemies
cause greed cant be satisfied by money and jealousys a disease
oh if you dont learn from history what a blind man see
i take the roads less travelled im on my way
i take the roads less travelled see you again one day
the more i love the more hurt i feel
and thats all right by me cause thats just how i be
i could be like a brother sold out for a million dollar
i could be like a brother despising one another
and aunty said choices you make chances you take
and to be free to be free to be free you got to be brave
i take the roads less travelled im on my way
i take the roads less travelled ill see you some day
i take the roads less travelled im on my way

the world to peace and prosperity

that weve been reading between the lines

i can remember when uh those slavery times
what you wont and what you will
working for your dollar bill
sad to see the old slave mill
is grinding slow but grinding still
walking home a youth gets killed
police free to shoot at will
sad to see the old slave mill
is grinding slow but grinding still
nine to five you know the drill
weekends are a shortlived thrill
sad to see the old slave mill
is grinding slow but grinding still
cup runneth over till it spill
take until theyve had their fill
sad to see the old slave mill
is grinding slow but grinding still
some of us think were too big
cah the system gives us jobs
even though its just a low paying gig
some of us will boast and brag
and those of us who think were small
just because we dont have much
thats really not the case at all
theres riches that the flesh cant touch
some of us wont respect names
some of us wont respect loves
some of us dont respect life
even though we worship god
and some of us wont let go faith
no matter what the price may cost
some of us wont practice hate
becah we still believe in love
what you wont and what you will
working for a dollar bill
sad to see the old slave mill
is grinding slow but grinding still
walking home a child gets killed
neighbours free to shoot at will
hurts to see the old slave mill
is grinding slow but grinding still
nine to five we know the drill
weekends are such a shortlived thrill
sad to see the old slave mill
is grinding slow but grinding still
cup runneth over till it spill
take until theyve had their fill
sad to see the old slave mill
is grinding slow but grinding still
most of us think were too good
just because material gain
if we were living as we should
then less of us would be in pain
those who are misunderstood
still deserve a voice to claim
the things that are still meaningful
to each and all of us the same
and some will say the cups halffull
and give jah thanks for what weve gained
and some will say theres much more weight to pull
and them will tell you that straight up and plain
and some will think outside the box
while some of us will hold our lanes
and some of us rewrite the facts
while some of us a chop down cane
what men wont and what they will
working for a dollar bill
sad to see the old slave mill
is grinding slow but grinding still
walking home a child gets killed
police free to shoot at will
hurts to see the old slave mill
is grinding slow but grinding still

until tonight

teach them to be careful while at play
theres nothing wrong with having fun
dont let the system tame you
its just a part of being young
and even though theyre quick to blame you
picking on you like a plum
because your dream became true
now look what theyve become
an open sight in plain view
theyve already had a run
so meanwhile they try to change you
its not over till its done

its all apart of growing up
and were all young enough to learn to
and dont you live life in a rush

walking in the darkness
like a predator from the wild
looking for those who are gasping
for the last breath to take them away
some to a better place
some to a place where
the fires never stop burning
you can cry for help
no one is listening
cause everyone is deaf
from the death that is surrounding them
no angel takes you home
no angel takes you to heaven
but the soul taker comes
and takes your soul away
his eyes shines wild fire
and he s here to take you away
hes the
chorus
soul taker soul taker
soul taker takes your soul
you gotta be ready

i pray thee i pray thee once again
i wonder to be surrounded by ones with such talent
you know
speak life
live a humble and meek life
ordinary day of the week life
try to search and seek life
way up
keep your head up and stay up
even when you sore and pain love
never giving up till its game up
keep your aim up
and focus
dont concentrate on whats bogus
never sell out for a bonus
handle your bis like grown ups
own up
its amazing
the way jah fire keeps blazing
thats why i constantly praise him
for some of them its a phase thing
so theyre gazing
on the street lights
till dem catch up in street fights
cause are pretending theyre street wise
and put an end to a brief life
i feel like
its a mystery
how we can keep repeating our history
making the same mistakes as our ancestry
seem like all of life lessons missed with
its risky
so give praises
one day you may find your oasis
rise up to the challenge youre faced with
be a pool and creative
youll make it
its basics
people been doing it for ages
many other cultures and places
on the regular basis
theyre so many cases
lets face it man
way too much time has been wasted man
building military bases
fighting our war with no basis
life is sacred
and every baby born naked
some a nah gwaan like dem raise big
and dont care what theyre making
they cant take it
so speak life man
all this darkness no feel right man

where theres more hungry mouths
than food to eat
its where the homeless
roam the street
where broken glass
and broken dreams
are shattered and scattered
amongst debris
sufferation wrath
and still they laugh
and dream of a mansion
above the half
no one to speak
upon there behalf
now tell me do they stand a chance
where theres more food
than mouths to feed
where you find those who
claim to lead
because of all their personal greed
they always want more than they need
they dont help those
below the half
instead they stand aside and laugh
as if its all well ever ask
when will they make a change
chorus yami bolo
children lift your heads
to the one
who create the sun
my children
and your light will come shinning again
show the world
jah love is okay
when we rise and greet the sun
lets give him thanks and praise
verse
illegal guns
they roam the night
in hungry hands
waiting to bite
the first sign of
any food in sight
youths in the dark
searching for light
hard time they face
is not a choice
police curfew
is no surprise
and with no one
to be there voice
do they stand a chance
where theres more hungry mouths
then food to eat
where you find those who
claim to lead
because of all there personal greed
they always want more than they need
they dont help those
below the ave
instead they stand aside and laugh
as if its all well ever ask
when will they make a change
verse
its like a punk never check
or dem did forget
say a death
we nature naughty
ah true mi go born uptown
tell dem fools dont cross me
thats only where cindy brought me
and thats why they cant impress me
with no boasty car
me know dat ah kill dem softly
and then theyre not
really even who they think they are
theyre not really moving crafty
mi get fi understand
say them plan dem faulty
well nuff a dem a twenty
and favor forty
filthy rich big belly
and hearty
di real gideon will
be arriving shortly
rasta nuh beat binghi

and dem cant assault we
so haile rastafari love

im talking bout love thats my favourite topic
open up your heart and let nothing stop it
even though i try sometimes i hide the pain
i was born in love is running through my veins
so i showed love i gave it all away
this is the only law that we must obey
as tears fall from the clouds above
while the angels sing i give dem all my love
i see the tears on your face

that hes never been to all his life he says
i wish i was home i wish i was in africa
i wish i was home i wish i was in africa
i have seen his world
ive seen the other world i have nothing to say
i put my coat on my shoulders
as i walked away i heard myself sing
the grass is greener on the other side
til you get there and see it for yourself
the grass is greener on the other side
til you get there and see it for yourself
the grass is greener on the other side
til you get there and see it for yourself
his name is themba
he lives in soweto
every morning he goes to the airport to watch the planes come and go
he has changed his african name to a western one
cause he doesnt know how it hurts to have a name
you cant be proud of he hopes that one day
one of these birds of the sky can take him away
to a very very far land
running away from the very roots
that so many black people in the world
are wanting to come back to a place they call home
they wish they were home
they wish they were in africa
they wish they were in africa
i live in his world ive seen the other world
i got nothing to say
i put my coat on my shoulders
as i walked away i heard myself sing
the grass is greener on the other side
til you get there and see it for yourself
the grass is greener on the other side
til you get there and see it for yourself
the grass is greener on the other side
til you get there and see it for yourself

we come from so far and life is full of surprises
just know ill never change no iâ€™ll never change
no matter the circumstances though this road can be demanding
iâ€™ll always be the same always be the same
never lose sight of who you are temptation comes from near and far
wounds heal but leave a scar
make sure from the start its from your heart
chorus
because didnâ€™t you know that the higher you go
itâ€™s the more youll expose if youâ€™re a thorn or a rose
because didnâ€™t you know that the higher you go
itâ€™s the more youll expose if youâ€™re a thorn or a rose
black thought
yo
were all products of the same stem same blood and same skin
same ghetto flower growing from the same pavement
rising to the challenge of this world and trying to stay in it
paying tears and sweat paying dues and paying rent
never shall i stumble i stay on the same wavelength
yeah the game is savage yo itâ€™s primitive its cavemen
only way to save men and free them from enslavement
start to over stand each other like a native language
guiding one another down this road full of changes
although its full of dangers we got to be courageous
let the vibes spread and make your bravery contagious
know youâ€™re going through the same book but different pages
people can be so vain hustling can be so painful
and make you feel like all you do is work for no gain
but before it bottles up the flames like propane
inhale and exhale no stress and no strain
chorus

i can still remember
when we were much younger
skies were blue and fields were green
oh the airâ€™s so clean
animals ran wild and free
birds could sing in harmony
flowers would grow all around
and mother earth was sound
chorus
in those good good old days
in those good good old days
in those good good old days
that used to be
where did all the green fields go
and flowers now that just wonâ€™t grow
animals are dying out
that lives north and south
they found out how to crack the skies
casting shadows on our eyes
telling us just how to live
and when to die
chorus
but those good good old days
yes those good good old days
in those good good old days
that used to be
wasting oil upon the sea
that used to be so fresh and free
poisoned gases everywhere
stifling the air
and many children lose their way
by leaders of confusion
and leave them with the price to pay
of hastened evolution
chorus
but those good good old days
in those good good old days
yes those good good old days
that used to be
talking â€˜bout those good old days
talking â€˜bout those good old good old days
donâ€™t you remember
try to remember
iâ€™m sure you know
iâ€™m sure you know

how long shall they kill our prophets
while we stand aside and look
but little did he know that
eventually the enemy
will stand aside and look
while we slash and kill
our own brothers
knowing that already
they are the victims of the situation
still licking wounds from brutality
still licking wounds from humiliation
she said all these words and the
wrinkles on her face became
perfect trails for the tears and she said
chorus x3
we are the victims everytime
we got double trouble everytime
she took me outside to the churchyard
showed me graves on the ground
and she said
there lies a man who fought for equality
there lies a boy who died in his struggle
can all these heroes die in vain
while we slash and kill our own brothers
knowing that already they are the
victims of the situation
still licking wounds from brutality
still licking wounds from humiliation

to get out of situations
then i wonder why
we dont mean what we say
then i remembered the terrible truth
about the truth
chorus
if you stand for the truth
you will always stand alone
the holy book tells us
the truth will set us free
but in this world i know different
do you believe in the truth
do you believe in righteousness
do you believe in innocent
till proven guilty
cause those that tell the truth
are always on the run oh god
then i wonder why
we dont mean what we say
then i remembered the terrible truth
about the truth
chorus
