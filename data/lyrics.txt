400 years (400 years, 400 years. Wo-o-o-o)
And it's the same -
The same (wo-o-o-o) philosophy
I've said it's four hundred years;
(400 years, 400 years. Wo-o-o-o, wo-o-o-o)
Look, how long (wo-o-o-o)
And the people they (wo-o-o-o) still can't see.
Why do they fight against the poor youth of today?
And without these youths, they would be gone -
All gone astray
Come on, let's make a move:
(make a move, make a move. Wo-o-o-o, wo-o-o-o)
I can (wo-o-o-o) see time (wo-o-o-o) - time has come,
And if-a fools don't see
(fools don't see, fools don't see. Wo-o-o-o)
I can't save the youth:
The youth (wo-o-o-o) is gonna be strong.
So, won't you come with me;
I'll take you to a land of liberty
Where we can live - live a good, good life
And be free.
Look how long: 400 years, (400 years, 400 years) -
Way too long! (wo-o-o-o)
That's the reason my people (wo-o-o-o) - my people can't see.
Said, it's four hundred long years - (400 years, 400 years. Wo-o-o-o)
Give me patience (wo-o-o-o) - same philosophy.
It's been 400 years, (400 years, 400 years)
Wait so long! Wo-o-o-o, wo-o-o-o.
How long? 400 long, long years.

Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
And where have you been my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.
Oh, what did you see, my blue eyed son?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand takers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin'
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin'
I heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.
Oh, who did you meet my blue-eyed son?
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman whose body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded and hatred
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
And what'll you do now my darling young one?
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'
I'll walk to the deepths of the deepest black forest
Where the people are a many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And I'll tell and think it and speak it and breathe it
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'
But I'll know my songs well before I start singin'
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

Anything that you ever want, it's yours
Access granted, girl
For granted, don't you take my love

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Would you believe me if I told you?
Will you believe me when I say?
[Chorus]
Affairs of the hearts
Together we’ve grown
If ever apart
All I want u to know
Is your love is life changing
And I couldn’t be the same without you darling
Your love is life saving
You always catch me when I fall
When the tour bus drop off
And all light lock off and I’m a mere mortal again
Promoter belly full and all the fans gone home
I’m glad that you’re more than a friend
Ooman your love is life changing
And I couldn’t be the same without you darling
Your love is life saving
You always catch me when I fall
There’s people just like you and me 
We pass them in the traffic
That never fall in love and so me have it say me lucky
‘nuff a dem nuh fortunate enough to have somebody
Some just cannot see beyond the flesh and its so funny
Never get too caught up in yourself to feel the magic
True love come and pass you by in life that is so tragic
Opportunity is scarce so take it while you have it
Nuh wait ‘til you a panic
Well the last man yu deh wid mek a big mistake
Lef’ an’ gone fi good and miss out something weh great
Loyal and full a faith when nuff a dem a move fake
Our ting separate we can’t separate
‘cause I would miss yu baby
And I can’t do without yu darling
Yes and I would miss yu baby
Girl yu know I love yu bad
[Chorus]
Affairs of the heart
Together we’ve grown
If things fall apart
All I want u to know
Ooman your love is life changing
And I couldn’t be the same without you darling
Your love is life saving
You always catch me when  I fall
When I’m away it’s like my songs all waste because you’re not near to hear me
If I lost my way I’d know I’d be ok ‘cus you’d be there to care me
And ooman I can see tings clearly
You genuine because you love sincerely
You never let me down not even nearly
Not even barely
Girl you know I love yu bad
Some see the laughter and don’t see the tears
Some see the courage and don’t see the fear
Some for themselves and they don’t intend to share
Some say a love and only pretend to care
Well nuff a dem a just miss congeniality
Dem pretty face and dem nah face reality
Well dem a quantity ooman yu a quality
Girl yu know I love yu bad
[Chorus]
Affairs of the heart
Together we’ve grown
If ever apart
All I want you to know
Is your love is life changing
I couldn’t be the same without you darling
Your love is life saving
You always catch me when I fall

From where I stand
I can see the world
Getting smaller and smaller
And there'll be no place
For people like you Georgie
Who still live in the past
When you couldn't do things
For yourself, you blamed it on apartheid
You blamed it on the government and everybody
Now is the time to prove yourself
If you think affirmative action
Is the way out... no way... no way.
Constitution can be changed
From time to time,
But that does not mean that
You don't need no education
We are tired of people who
Think that affirmative action is the way out
And, is another way of putting puppets
Where they don't belong
I'm so sorry Georgie
But the only way to get our economy
Strong, is to have
An educated nation
And if you think affirmative action
Is the way out... no way... no way.
[Chorus]
Education is still the key
Even though we have Affirmative action.

Wake up your love in the morning

[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
Said she wants my loving all night
And when she get it, she'll be all right (all right)
Said she wants my loving all night
And when she get it, she'll be all right
[Verse 1: Stephen Marley]
Now she call me on the phone and said she's home alone
And she want me to come over and her house a home
Well I gave it to her once
And I liked how she responds
Well now i'm in trouble 
Yeah
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
It seems she needs to oil her spine
Tell all a gyal toast bread can't build di putty gold mine
Need all di doctor to fish with di essential slime
She tell me she want signal di plane n' time me want slow wine
Turn on di HBO she want fi watch Showtime
Give her di cordless microphone, she want di one with line
Seem like me and young gyal ya just can't combine
So it's sour like lime
Running it down the line Mr. Muffin one timr
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
She call mi pon di I-95
How mi ah tek so long she ah wonder which car mi drive
Tired fi listen album now and she want me live
Tell me she want mi fi come knock her out till she can't revive
SO!...Ah so mi planet and di stars align
She tell me she want me know which part her hills and valley dem join
Seh she want me ride her like a Ferrari sign
Put appointment aside
Nothing can't compromise
Fi di vibes I provide
BIM!
[Solo: Stephen Marley]
She wants my loving all night
When she get it, she all right
She wants my loving all night
[Verse 4]
I shouldn't make no physical contact, tell her fi hold down and still she just can't quiet
Seh mi tek her up and tun her inna $@# maniac
Telling me dat I compliment her natural habitat
Well...it seem like she deaf or she blind
Want come step inna mi life when time she deh far behind
Want mi play her rhythm till di tape want rewind
And she nah watch no time
And she just nah resign till she see the sunshine
OK!

Verily I say, thats what I’m living for. Amen, amen.
By the still waters we lay; in the green grass we play.
It cost to keep this world afraid, a price that we just cant pay.
To keep the monsters from the gates, we gonna pull together.
For the suffering to be saved, hey, we gonna to pull together!
Verily I say, time is now. Amen, amen.
Verily I say, it has begun. Amen, amen.
Verily I say and here I come.
Verily I say, I’m the first born son. Amen, amen.

Another heartache, another heartbreak
And all those things that
I've done to make you mine
Hoping and pretending is all that I could do
Ever since my only love is true
And in the nights I keep waiting at my door
Just to see your loving face once more
Another heartache, another heartbreak
I can't count the teardrops
I've cried since you've been gone
Now hoping and pretending is all that I could do
Ever since my only love is true
And in the nights I keep waiting at my door
Just to see your loving face once more
Another heartache, another heartbreak
I can't count the teardrops
I've cried since you've been gone

Any day now
I will hear you say goodbye my love
And you'll be on your way
Then my wild, beautiful bird
You will have flown
Any day now I'll be all alone
Any day now
When your restless eyes
Meet someone new
Oh to my sad surprise
Then the blue shadows will fall
All over town
Any day now, now love will let me down
I know I shouldn't want to keep you
If you don't want to stay
Until you're gone forever
I'll keep holding on for dear life
Holding you this way
Begging you to stay
Any day now
When the clock strikes go
You'll call it off
And then my tears will flow
Then the blue shadows will fall
All over town
Any day now, now
Love will let me down
'Cause you won't be around
No, don't fly away
My beautiful bird
Don't, don't fly away
My beautiful bird
Well.. why oh why..

Oh, autumn seems to never end
The leaves are always brown
Summer seems to never tend
To ever come around
Spring times are for beginnings
When true love is found
Winters are for finishings
True love stands its grounds
Now I hear no happy songs
Birds have all gone south
Bright green pastures drying up
And plenty turn to drought
Life is full of ups and downs
The carousels of love
Good times, bad times, smiles and frowns
Don't give up.. on me
Don't give up.. on me
Time flies by while having fun
It's all gone in a wink
And now the days feel more like much
Don't know what to think
Life is full of ups and downs
The carousels of love
Good times, bad times, smiles and frowns
Don't give up.. on me
Don't give up.. on me
Time flies by while having fun
It's all gone in a wink
Now the days feel more like months
Who knows what to think?
Life is full of ups and downs
The carousel of love
Good times, bad times, smiles and frowns
Darling, don't give up.. on me
Yeh, oh.. on me
Don't give up.. on me
Don't give up.. on me

Do, do, do, do, do, oh, oh, oh
Fret not for tomorrow
'Cause I know there will be no sorrow
Don't matter what the crisis
I will be your rescue
No, I'm not going to take no for that
'Cause I know just where it's at
B for butter and T for tat
When it comes to loving someone, girl, you know
I'm in love with you
When it comes to holding and kissing
Girl, you know I'd do anything for you

Oh, oh, ba da, oh, oh ba da, oh ba da
Oh no, I just can't understand
How come you want a change of plans?
What did I do to break your heart?
Tell me the story from the start
Play it cool, oh yeah, come on baby
Oh, oh, ba da, oh, oh ba da, oh ba da
Come on and tell me why
you wanna say bye bye
Oh no, I just can't understand
How come you want a change of plans?
Oh, oh, ba ya, oh, oh ba ya, oh ba ya
What did I do to break your heart?
Tell me the story from the start
Oh yeah, tell me baby, I wanna know
Oh no, I just can't understand
How come you want a change of plans?
Oh ba ya, oh, oh, ba ya
Oh ba ya, oh, oh, ba ya

Now I know that you're not smart
How you said goodbye and love yourself
Baby, don't do it
Don't break your own heart
Even though I'll give you another chance
Oh girl, even though I'll give you another chance
Now I know you know you're mistake
And you'll never try to hurt yourself again
'Cause you have done me no wrong
Baby, can't you understand
Don't you ever try to hurt yourself anymore
Oh girl, don't you try to hurt yourself anymore
Hello, my baby, oh yeah
Baby, don't do it, yeah
Now I know that you're not wise
Look how you made yourself look sad
Baby, don't do it
Don't break your own heart
Even though I'll give you another chance
Oh girl, even though I'll give you another chance
Baby, don't do it
Oh, oh, babe, baby, don't you do it
Baby, don't do it

[Junior Reid:]
Babylon..
Babylon
[Dead Prez:]
Look what they doing, despicable, inhuman
And got the nerve to say that I'm 3/5ths of a human
Babylon is in ruins, inhabited by a beast
A bloodsucker, vampire to say the least
Look at the way that they're gnashing their teeth as they feast
Fighting to get a piece, something like Ancient Greece
Permanent Halloween, Trick or Treat
We're walking like zombies out in these streets
Shackled our hands and feet, what you see, what you see?
[Stephen Marley:]
Down there in Babylon
Where transgression increaseth
There they know no love
Hopeless are the days
Hold I stead 'Fari (Jah!)
From their wicked life
Smiles upon their faces
Evil in their hearts
Oh my, oh
Oh a oh, oh I..
[Junior Reid:]
Babylon, Babylon
Babylon, Babylon
Babylon, I know me know your kingdom a go fall down
Jah will never give you the crown
Babylon, I know me know your kingdom a go fall down
Long you try fi hold Rasta down (that's right)
Babylon, I know me know your kingdom a go fall down (yeah)
Rasta nuh 'fraid of no clown
[Dead Prez:]
Babylon is a Devil inna blue dress, Satan in a suit and tie
Oppression is freedom, Heaven is Hell and the truth is a lie
They murder the youth, the police don't shoot in the sky
It's a warzone, you do what you gotta do to survive
You get suited and ride, life is hustle or starve
This is capitalism religion, money is god
America eats the young like cannibal breakfast
Wall Street is swarming with Hannibal Lecters
Crooked elections, politricks of the shitstem
Legal lynchings, modern day crucifixions
Slaves to the current conditions that we live in
More faith in the reverends than making our own heaven
It's foul, how the youth glued to the television
Ain't heard of Assata, but Twitter following Paris Hilton
It's only right we want to be more than poor and righteous but
Even the rich today can't ignore the crisis in Babylon..
[Stephen Marley:]
Oh my, oh
Oh a oh, oh I..
[Junior Reid:]
Babylon no waan fi see the youths dem wield together
All they want we do, dem waan we fight we one anedda
Dem no waan fi see [?]
Survival, we [?] to any weather
Stephen Marley, Junior Reid, Deed Prez
Stephen Marley, Junior Reid, Deed Prez
And so, from that tiem to this time
The fall of Babylon has been prophesied
And just like heaven and earth will share
Before one of these words pass away
As we speak today, Babylon persists, to fall..

Back out, this is the rout!

I went to a party the other night
They said it's gonna be right there
But when we were at the party
I was disappointed
All we could hear there was their crackadoo
All we could hear there was their shoo-bee doobee
And the music they played there
Was not good for a Rastaman
Was not good for any Jah-man - and now
I'm going back to my roots, yeah-eh
Reggae music is all that I need
I'm going back to my roots, yeah-eh
Reggae music is all that I need
I'm going back to my roots, yeah-eh
Reggae music is all that I need
Reggae is mine, reggae is mine yeah, yeah

I'm going back to my roots, yeah-eh
Reggae music is all that I need
I'm going back to my roots, yeah-eh
Reggae music is all that I need..

Well, I hope you understand I just gotta go back to the island
Now the day is gone and I sit alone, thinking of you, girl
What can I do without you in my life?
I guess that our guessing game just had to end that way
The hardest one to lose of all the games we played
Now the time has passed of living in a dream world
Lying to myself, can't make that scene
Of wondering if you love me or just making a fool of me
Well, I hope you understand I just gotta go back to my island
And watch the sun go down
(Sit and watch the sun go down)
Hear the sea roll in
(Listen to the sea roll in)
And I'll be thinking of you
(Yes, and I'll be thinking of you)
And how it might have been
(Thinking how it might have been)
Hear the night birds cry
(Listen to the night birds cry)
See the sunset die
(Sit and watch the sunset die)
Well, I hope you understand I just gotta go back to the island
Of all the fun we had, it's still raining in my heart
I know down in my soul I'm surely gonna miss you
But it had to end that way of all the games we played
Well, I hope you understand I just gotta go back to the island
And watch the sun go down
(Sit and watch the sun go down)
Hear the sea roll in
(Listen to the sea roll in)
And I'll be thinking of you
(Yes, and I'll be thinking of you)
And how it might have been
(Thinking how it might have been)
Hear the night birds cry
(Listen to the night birds cry)
See the sunset die
(Sit and watch the sunset die)
Well, I hope you understand I just gotta go back to the island
I got to go back, I got to go back, I got to go back, see the sunset die

The system's got too much control, and they don't wanna let it go
I'm a prisoner fighting to be free, I'm breaking out of captivity
Be free, be free
To be free
Little by little, I'm losing control
As little by little my rights erode
I stop the deputy, now you know
Mama don't try, you see I got to go
[Chorus]
The government's got too much control,
Now is there some place that we can roll
the politics of fear and oppression is everywhere now
the law is closing in, just take what you can bring
[Chorus]
The system's got too much control,
now is there some place that we can roll
I'm a prisoner fighting to be free, the law is closing in
just take what we can bring

I tried my best - never to stop love you
To be there for you, oh
You make my life so miserable
Jealousy and problems, coming to our lifes
We've been together for so long
And we've been through so much
Try to do right
But everything I do, seems to go wrong
If I didn't love you baby
I'll be long gone
I need you now, I need you to be strong
Be strong, be strong, be strong
Everytime I go out, she always accuse me
Smelling me and telling me, who's perfume is that
Why don't you trust me, you know I'm always faithfull
I'm only looking at the girl, but babs I don't touch
We've been together for so long
And we've been through so much
Try to do right
But everything I do, seems to go wrong
If I didn't love you baby
I'll be long gone
I need you now, I need you to be strong
Be strong, be strong, be strong
We've been together for so long
And we've been through so much
Try to do right
But everything I do, seems to go wrong
If I didn't love you baby
I'll be long gone
I need you now, I need you to be strong
Be strong, be strong, be strong
Oh....na..na..na...
Be strong, be strong, be strong...

On the beach in Hawaii
I wish you were here with me, walking on the beach in Hawaii
playing on the golden sand, looking at the ocean now I understand
love is like the open sea, and I wish you were here with me
on the beach in Hawaii
Since you've been gone away, I think about you everyday
don't you know I miss you much, and you know I need your touch
I'm on a rocky cliff, oh I wish you were here with me
on the beach in Hawaii
A little pakalolo, and I say mahalo
ujjayi breathing, to get a real feeling
yogi gonna let you know
that I wish you were here with me
on the beach in Hawaii

Take a look into the sky
'Cause the world is not so pretty
Free myself from worries
So I can see
It's just a beautiful day
It's just a beautiful day
You could be sad
But I rather you not be
Don't dwell on the negative
Just the positivity
And it's a beautiful day
It's just a beautiful day
We're always trying to satisfy these wants and needs
Take you some time for that inner peace
When your eyes are open
You'll see things differently
There's so much gloom
Hiding the reality
It's just a beautiful day
Yeah, It's just a beautiful day
Take a look into the sky
Wake up
Take a look into the sky
Keep your head up high
Take a look into the sky
I take a look into the sky
'Cause the world is not so pretty
Free myself from worries
So I can see
It's just a beautiful day
I could be sad
But you rather me not be
Don't dwell on the negative just the positivity
And it's a beautiful day
And it's a beautiful day
We're always trying to satisfy these wants and needs
Take you some time for that inner peace
When our eyes are open
We'll see things differently
There's so much gloom
Hiding the reality
It's just a beautiful day
A beautiful day
Take a look into the sky
Wake up
Take a look into the sky
Look in the sky
Keep your head up high
It's just a beautiful day
I know it's a beautiful day
It's just a beautiful day
I know it's a beautiful day
No one can take that away
It's just a beautiful day
I know it's a beautiful day
Don't you feel no way
It's just a beautiful day

Beautiful Mother Nature
She looked at me with a smile on her face
Then she started to cry
She said why did my children forsake me
She felt like she was dying
Oh ungrateful children
When she was young she was beautiful and strong
The more children she had the more things went wrong
Now she's feeling old and cold
And her heart doesn't feel love anymore
Beautiful Mother Nature
She sat me down and told me to sing her a song
Maybe it would make her feel better
Maybe her children would sing along
And see the wrong we have done
Make amends to mend her heart
She still wouldn't hate none of her children
No matter what cruel things they've done
She'll always be there when her babies are crying
She's a mother a mother you can depend on
Beautiful Mother Nature
She's hoping her children will love her again
Like once she remember
Before skyscrapers and chemical plants
When she was all that we had
Before they polluted her sacred land
Now her tears are falling like acid rain
And her voice sounds like earthquake
I had to beg her Mother please don't leave
Give another chance I'll talk to the kids
Beautiful Mother Nature
She was my
Beautiful Mother Nature
Still is my
Beautiful Mother Nature
She is my
Beautiful Mother Nature
Still is my

Yeah, she's such a beautiful woman
And she have so many ugly men
And when she go to the market place
She'd leave all characters at home, oh
And she walk like a lady
Act like a lady, don't ask me why
But when she start her conversation
Every one of her friends just cry of shame
Sing along
Beautiful woman, beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman will drive you crazy
Look here and here comes Billy
And he's one of her ugly men
He says, "Hello, friend"
Then I began to tell the story
About this beautiful woman that I have seen
Then Billy turns to me and said
"She's like every woman, it's the same"
Then I shake my head and said
"No, let me tell you Billy, I can't believe
Every woman could be the same"
Sing along
A hey, beautiful woman, beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman will drive you crazy
Look here, here comes good ol' Sam
Come to town, met this girl, fall in love
And the girl keep driving him crazy
She just actin' like a lady for a short time
And she walk like a lady, act like a lady
Don't ask me why
I know when she get warmed up
Then she get started
Then she get crazy
She'll take off every piece of her clothes in the street
Sing along
Beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman, beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman will drive you crazy
Aha, beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman, beautiful woman
A beautiful woman, beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman will drive you crazy
Aha, beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman

[Verse 1]
And me and she we trampoose a lot
Several mornings she shampoos my locks
Always have my back she stand true to dat
Real type of loving, thank you for that
Yow...run barefoot without no shoes and socks
Cause she keep herself clean mi nah go catch no rash
And she love me for real mi nuh haffi have no cash
And any little thing from mi splish she splash
Yow...all this blinging it's like you forgot
Use cheddar as the bait den you recruit a rat
So we listen couple speech of Martin Luther chat
Dennis Brown, Bob Marley and some Super Cat
Yow...seem like she upside the duko shop
Cause she don't have a scratch it's only beautiful spot
When one duty start is when one duty stop
One nine to five, one five to twelve o'clock
You see me
[Chorus: Bobby Brown]
Beautiful
Here we go again
My love, you know
I will never let you go
My love
Beautiful
Here we go
[Verse 2]
And I remember when we met and we began dating
And everything was copacet' and we began mating
And then the way mi love her good, she gimme don ratings
Because mi style dem plentiful and ah nuh one way thing
And she get belly full and ah nuh pot scrapings
And the closer we become the more she gravitating
Until we buckle down and there is no escaping
Now it typically became an everyday thing
Regularly, physically communicating sexually, scientifically penetrating
Until she start spiritually resonating
Ah so mi know she real and seh she ah nuh play thing
She is the only Queen, the King is designating
And so mi seal the deal I am negotiating
I know it's kinda deep but keep on concentrating
Cause Jazzy lay di beat and I am clearly stating

If we both believe in Reincarnation,
Maybe we will have a
Chance in the next life.
You felt something for me
And I was so deeply in love with you.
But we both said nothing
Till we ran out of time
Sometimes I cry,
I said I cry
And it's not because of the pain I feel inside
And it's not because of the hurt I feel inside
But I cry,
I said I cry
Sometimes I cry
And I remember the days
When love was so far away from me,
The only time I knew about love was
When mommy and daddy told me they loved me,
And I didn't know that today it would be
Me having got to say I love you
But I remember that
[Chorus:]
Big boys don't cry
And sometimes
I cry
I said I cry.
And it's not because of the pain I feel inside
And it's not because of the hurt I feel inside
But I cry
I see your beautiful face
Everytime I close my eyes,
You reach out for me I reach out for you
But in real life we cannot meet, Oh!
That is why I cry,
I said I cry
And it's not because of the pain I feel inside
And it's not because of the hurt I feel inside
But I cry
And I remember the days
When love was so far away from me,
The only time I heard about love was
When mommy and daddy told me they loved me,
And I didn't know that today it would be
Me having got to say I love you,
But I remember that
[Chorus]

Bim Today, Bam Tomorrow
I want you tell me the truth girl
Do you feel all right now?
I want you tell me the truth girl
Do you understand me?
Remember I told you that there will be another festival again
What a bim and bam sir
Remember I told you that there will be another happy time again
What a bim and bam sir
I want you tell me, tell me the truth girl
Do you feel all right now?
I want you tell me the truth girl
Do you understand me?
Remember I told you that there will be a nother happy time again
What a bim and bam sir
I want yo tell Ms. Louise Bennett that I say
To tell Mr. Ronnie Williams that I say
That it is coming on a holiday festival again
What a bim and bam sir
I want you tell me the truth girl
This is a bim and bam sir
What a bam and bim sir
What a bim and bam sir

My blood bitter, my blood bitter, my blood bitter, my blood bitter
My blood shoot a sheriff, uplift Africa
Spread one love with a song and a guitar
Mek crazy bald heads start run quicker
Clear all perimeter
My blood bitter, my blood bitter, my blood bitter, my blood bitter
My blood bitter, my blood bitter, my blood bitter, my blood bitter

Today I'll sing you a black song, you need to hear about beautiful black things 'cause
Most time we hear about black, we hear about black magic and black witches
Black list, black book, black market
Black Friday, ya spend off your black riches
I've never seen a doctor in black nor seen a black pill fi cure no black people
But I've seen bush doctors like Tosh and Marley resurrect like a real black beatle
Malcom, Marcus, Martin
When you see Walter Rodney ask him
How you nuh hear about Howell often
So when the little offspring asking, tell them
They never told us that black is beautiful
They never told us, black is beauty
They never told us that black is beautiful
They never told us, they never told us black is beautiful
You ah behave and ah gwaan like you never spend 500 years pon a farm
The same chain you ah wear and a gwaan is another black life in Sierra Leone
Dem find out mama earth got gold then
Dem mine out mama earth black soul then
You work hard just fi get ah black card
Same card weh you swipe buy back your black gold then
Hol' on, I see nuff faces long
But this is not a racist song
This is a song for the children who was never told about where their race is from
They never hear it in dem favourite songs
Everybody calm, ah say slavery's done
What a go gwaan when the babies come
And start read 'bout things like
Dogons, black Kemet and Kush
Black kings, black senates and books
Weh teach 'bout pyramids and put
Real significance to we physical looks
So every word weh mi say black
In my world everything black
Black white, white black right back
So don't be surprised when mi say mi king black
They never told us that black is beautiful
They never told us, black is beauty
They never told us that black is beautiful
They never told us, they never told us black is beautiful

In front of Gucci in the winter, I seen ya witcha girl
Just walkin' uh - in ya chin chilla fur
I was laid up - in the coupe back shade up
Lookin' at cha face, just pure wit no make up
A little bit a mack lip gloss, hair in a bun well done
Lookin' for a ring, I seen none
So I hopped out the coupe
In hot pursuit 
To stop and introduce
Like I'm Shyne, and you?, you my destiny
And ya diamond cluster, to much just to touch ya
Perfume down to ya structure
Think I'll wait til the 2nd night to fuck ya 
I wanna marry you, nah I'm just playin'
But we can start wit a few nights out in Malibu surfin'
Playin' up on Persian
Here's my number 
Put in ya purse and call me 
[Chorus - Barrington Levy:]
On the telephone, she heard my voice
Tell me to pick her up in my Rolls Royce
If my Rolls Royce is not wit ladies
Then girl I'm gonna take you in my Mercedes
If my Mercedes will not fill up wit the disease

Wait press the brakes, gotta investigate

Whether my pockets is slim or fatter 
Whether it's BBQs or Mr.Childs platter

Even if the paragraphs didn't hit the charts and smash 
If my car was a train I'd a service it back

Cuz we right there, yo cardier chaunce

Breaking up, is hard to do
When you turned and you walked through that door
It hurts me sore, now
I said it hurts me sore, my darling
When you looked at me and you said, goodbye
You made me cry
I said you made me cry, my darling
So listen to me, what I say to you
Breaking up is hard to do, everybody knows
Breaking up is hard to do
And saying: If you've ever been in love
Then you'll realise just what I'm talking about
Breaking up is so.. very hard to do
It's hard to do
I cannot let you go now
'Cause my love is so strong
My love is so, strong
I said my love is so, so strong
And if you leave I will surely cry
Breaking up is hard to do
Breaking up is hard to do, everybody knows
Breaking up is hard to do
Breaking up is hard to do
Breaking up is hard to do..

You can't fool the youth
Don't blame them
Not their fault

Can't blame you when you're going
This is something you've got to do
You've got to go, ho ho
You've got to go, ho ho
Trying so hard not to cry
Since they say a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears keep running from my eyes
I remember the day I came to the city
My children were crying
My wife was scared she's gonna lose me
To the girls in the city
To make her feel alright
I said it's impossible
To make her feel alright
I said it's impossible
But I was wrong
Can't blame you when you're going
This is something you've got to do
You've got to go, ho ho
Can't blame you when you're going
This is something you've got to do
You've got to go, ho ho
You've got to go, ho ho
You've been keeping me here
All these years
As your private lover
Letters came from home
But I never answered
'Til tonight when I got this letter
From my little daughter saying
"Missing you daddy"
It's time to go
Can't blame you when you're going
This is something you've got to do
You've got to go, ho ho
You've got to go, ho ho
Can't blame you when you're going
This is something you've got to do
You've got to go, ho ho
You've got to go, ho ho
Letters came from home
But I never answered
'Til today when I got this letter
From my little daughter saying
"Missing you daddy"
See me now, see me no more
I heard that whistle blow
I knew it's time to go
Sitting here in this train
Going so fast past the trees
I'm thinking of words to apologize
'Cause sorry ain't enough
Can't blame you when you're going
This is something you've got to do
You've got to go, ho ho
You've got to go, ho ho

They just can't keep I down
I'll always be around
Never will they get I down
I'll always be around
I work real hard, night and day
Can't let no one just, take that away
I try in life, to do my best
But some would love to see me stoop to less
They just can't keep I down
I'll always be around
Never will they get I down
and I'll always, you'll always, he'll always, yeah
Some would love to sweep your feet off the ground
Ev'ry time you get up they keep pushing you down
The shortest way home is the long way round
The deepest rivers never make a sound
They just can't keep I down
I'll always be around
Never will they get I down
I'll always be around
I said they just can't keep I down
and I'll always be around
With the powers of jah jah jah jah
Can't keep I down [x15]
They just can't keep I down
I said they just can't keep I down

The plans we try to make
The treasures we are giving

Told me you loved me
Right from the start
Don't play no tricks
Don't break my heart
Told me you loved me
And I said why
You think I'm gonna cry
[Chorus:]
Can't you see
What you're doing to me
I am bound
You've got to set me free
You jerk on my heart
Shatter my brain
If you have conscience
Ain't that a shame
Told me you loved me
To make my cry
And I said I don't know why
[Chorus]
Then if you love me
Don't treat me so bad
I could give you something you never had
See you sitting up there
And you're looking so mad
Your imagination is making you sad
[Chorus]

So much careless Ethiopians
Have gone astray
So much careless Ethiopians
Have gone away
Hey, hey
They calling up an Antichrist
Each night and day
Pray for a God to come from outer space
So much careless Ethiopians
Have gone astray
So much careless Ethiopians
Have lost their way
Are you coming my way?
Are you coming my way?
I said I wonder what you do
You gotta come my way
Come my way
Is they know not where they're going?
They've gone astray

I can't believe that it's real
The way that she makes me feel
Its something deep down inside
Oh it's a feeling I just cannot hide
She's never been unfaithful to me
So we will always be
She's never been unfaithful to me
As far as I can see
She gave me love in the morning and in the evening too
She gave me love in when I'm lonely so I never felt blue
So ride on Cassandra ride on ride on ride on
Ride on Cassandra ride on ride on ride on

Won't you try to be loving, come here
When will war be the answer
To what you're looking for?
I can tell ya, no
It's deja-vu once again
It's the same old thing
Stop fussing and fighting, yeah
The truth is we're hurting
Can't you see it's not working
For me or you, for me or you
It's getting hard to unwind
In these modern times
You've got to free your mind
You've got to free your mind
Won't you try to be loving, Ceceil - hey
Won't you try to be loving, Ceceil, yeah, come
Won't you try to be loving, Ceceil - do it
Now won't you try to be loving, come here
Now my friend the dove
Oh, freed from its cage
Come on and celebrate
Let's have a holiday
I treat ya good
And ya treat me right
Coming out of the darkness
Gettin' into the light
Now I leave my pride
And your loftiness
Said we take it off
Until there's nothing left
Well, I present my face
To your inner and outer space
You don't have to hide your face
It's not a human disgrace
Won't you try to be loving
And we can be together
Sometime and by the weather
Bathing on the Caribbean Sea
Yo peace and harmony
That's what you mean to me
And that's the way we should be
No, don't forget your past
But we're back at last
And now it's what we lead
So much to live for
No need to die and kill for
What I believe
Hey, won't you try to be loving, Ceceil
Yeah, come on
Come on and try to be loving, come here

We're living in the world
With alot of crazy people
We're living in the world
With psychopaths
Everyone of them wants to rule
The world
Some people have the front row seat
At the top of the world
Some people have nothing but just a life
Problems are there left and right
Liars, cheaters, politicians and black stabbers
Making life a little bit more unbearable
It is a give or take world
So you got to take what you can when you can
Make the best of it. Wo!
[Chorus:]
Say yeah! Celebrate life
Say year! Life is good.
We're living in the world
With demented people
There's a man standing on the edge of the bridge
Ready to end it all
Some people don't know what life is worth
Some people have the front row seat at the gates of hell
You could be having problems right now
But there's no problem worth your life
People fight to stay alive every day
Cause they know, life is worth more than worries.
So you got to take what you can when can
Make the best of it, Wo! Ho! Wo! Ho!
[Chorus: till fade]
Say Yeah, yeah celebrate life
Say Yeah, yeah life is good.

Changes, changes, yeah
For ordinary people now
Changes, changes, yes
For ordinary people now
There's so much beauty in every breath that we take
Oh, won't you tell me, can you relate?
Needs of the many, the wants of the few
We can find religion in the freedom we choose
There's so much hurt all over the place
Oh, can't you tell by the look on my face?
And there's one thing that I must convey
Changes, changes, yeah
For ordinary people now, yeah
Changes, changes, yeah
For ordinary people now
I just can't help the way that I feel
We all want our dreams to be real
Yet circumstances that I just can't understand
Why does money got to make the man?
Everyone has an ego to feed
And every want is filled with greed
So here's one thing that I've got to say
Changes, changes, yeah, yeah
For ordinary people now
Yeah, changes, changes
For ordinary people now, y'all
Change for the better and not for the worse
Let's stand together and break our curses
We look off in the distance chasing dreams
But the things that I see with my eye's obscene
Let's plant a new tree, make a change
Need it for you and me, brighter days
Will come and you'll see, make the change
Necessary for ordinary people
There's so much beauty in every breath that we take
Oh, tell me, can you relate?
Needs of the many and the wants of the few
You can find religion in the freedom you choose
There's so much hurt all over the place
And I can tell by the look on your face
And there's one thing that we've got to say
Changes, changes
(Danny man say, brighten up your day and never feel no weight)
For ordinary people now
(Hear what we say, hear what we say)
Changes, changes
(Brighten up your day and don't feel no weight)
For ordinary people now
(Do you hear what we say? Do you hear what we say?)
Changes, changes
(Brighten up your day and don't feel no weight)
For ordinary people now
(Can you hear what we say? Hear what we say)
Changes, changes
(Brighten up your day, ain't gonna feel no pain)
For ordinary people now

Now that the change has come
We must have some fun
Now that the change has come
We must have some fun
Watching the kids playing on the lawn
They're looking gay as the bright sun shines
Nothing to worry about, nothing at all
'Cause now the change is here
Now that the change has come
We'll be praying all day long
Now that the change has come
We'll unite and live as one
We'll stop fussing and fighting among ourselves
'Cause now we have seen the light
Nothing to worry about, nothing at all
'Cause now the change is here
We'll stop fussing and fighting among ourselves
'Cause now we have seen the light
Nothing to worry about, nothing at all
'Cause now the change is here
Now that the change has come
We'll be praying all day long
Now that the change has come
We'll unite and live as one
Now that the change has come
We'll be praying all day long
Now that the change has come
We'll be praying all day long

Old man sitting by the side of the road
He's not watching the birds today
He's not watching the sunset like he always does
He's looking at the future
He has seen the past
School boy passes by interrupts his thoughts
He said sir, can you spare me a dollar
I got to make in time for my grade 8 class
I am fresh out of cigarettes
And I can't be late
The old man said
[Chorus:]
The world is changing
Take your time, look around
Make the right decision
He has no crystal ball
But he sees the future
Doesn't like what he sees, but what can he do
Little girl passes by with a baby in her arms
He thinks it's her mother's
But no, it is her own
She's only twelve years old for crying out loud
With his trembling finger
He wipes away the tears
If this is the future, he doesn't wanna be part of it
[Chorus:]
The world is changing
Take a time, look around
Make the right decision
Old man sitting by the side of his bed.
When he goes to sleep tonight
He won't have no sweet dreams
He'll be haunted by ghosts from the future
Welcome to the future.

Come we go burn down Babylon one more time
(Come we go burn down Babylon one more time);
Come we go chant down Babylon one more time

For them soft! Yes, them soft! (ah-yoy!)
Them soft! Yes, them soft! (ah-yoy!)
So come we go chant down Babylon one more time

Men see their dreams and aspiration-a
Crumble in front of their face,
And all of their wicked intention
To destroy the human race.
And how I know - and how I know - and that's how I know:
A Reggae Music, mek we chant down Babylon;
With music, mek we chant down Babylon;
This music, mek we chant down Babylon;
This music, come we chant down Babylon.
Come we go chant down Babylon one more time
(Come we go chant down Babylon one more time);
Come we go chant down Babylon one more time
(Come we go chant down Babylon);
For them soft! Yes, them soft! (ah-yoy!)
Them soft! Me say, Them soft! (ah-yoy!)
So come we go chant down Babylon one more time
(Come we go chant down Babylon)!
Me say, Music you're - music you're the key,
Talk to who? Please talk to me,
Bring the voice of - of the Rastaman,
Communicating to - 'cating to everyone.
How I (know) - how I know, how I (know) - how I know -
And that's how I know:
A Reggae Music, chant down - chant down - chant down Babylon,
Chant down Babylon, chant down Babylon,
Chant down Babylon!

Sitting by the door
One morning
Looking at the children going to school man, then I thought about the ones in the street
Moving up and down
No where to go
No education
No future
Then I thought about their parents man, why do they suffer so much
If they have parents why
(if you really don't want no children why do you have them, why) [x2]
[Chorus:]
We can fight and overcome
We can stop children from the street[x3]
It's a cold winter man, moving bare footed down in the street man
His father is relaxing in the best bar in town asking them to fill his glass man
His mother is kissing on another man
If you really don't want no children, why do you have them
If you can't care for them why...
[Chorus till fade]

Danny got of yellow school bus
Looking so sad today, you see it on his face
Mommy and Daddy have been fighting again
Every time they fight, he's caught in the middle of it all
He has dreams, like every little boy in the world.
But right now his main dream,
Is to get out of here.
Is to see Mommy and Daddy disappear forever.
He doesn't wanna hear those angry voices anymore
Danny, be careful what you wish for
You might just get it.
Be careful O! Oh! Oh!
[Chorus:]
You can choose your friend, but you cannot
Choose, who you related to.
He goes up to his room, he's not feeling good today
But it's no use, telling, nobody listens here
No use complaining, nobody cares around here
Little boys go to sleep and pray
For toys and candy, he prays for one thing
God I need a miracle down here
Will you make, Mommy and Daddy?
Disappear forever
Danny, be careful what you wish for
You might just, get it.
Be careful Oh! Oh! Oh!
[Chorus:]
You can choose your friend, but you cannot
Choose, who you related to.

[Chorus:]
Coming In Hot
Firin' some shot
Coming in red hot
It's a musical shot
I just clean up me nuzzle
I just load me barrel
And I cock me hammer
Cause I'm gonna pull my trigger
[Chorus]
One minute after dozing
I thought that I was a blazing
My blood it was a boiling
It was amazing
[Chorus]
Next day it went higher
Whole a me catch a fire
I couldn't take it no longer
I haffe chokin' on some cold ice water

I got up the other day
My heat it never went away
103 on the hour
I had to head for the shower
[Chorus]

Holy holy, hmm, holy holy
It started settle down in the drag to concentrate
And getting a weekly pay instead of begging every day
Father gave us every little thing to make us try
And help ourselves and He said He'd help those
Who try to help their selves
So if you want to be in that situation
Change your evil ways and join this congregation
And maybe you'll soon be living like the King
That sitteth on His throne
If happiness is far away, it will show up some day
Holy holy, holy holy
If you want to live that independent life
Go out and do the work instead of being in a fight
Father knows that you're the chosen one
To perform His works
And you'll be repaid in His holy way
In His holy way, yeah, yeah
In His holy way, yeah, holy way, yeah, holy way

No sun will shine in my day today (no sun will shine)
The high yellow moon won't come out to play (that high yellow moon won't come out to play)
I said (darkness) darkness (has come and covered my light) has covered my light,
(And has changed)
And has changed (my day into night) my day into night, yeah.
Where is the love to be found? (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Won't someone tell me 'cause
Life (sweet life) must be (got to be) somewhere to be found (out there somewhere out there for me)
Instead of concrete jungle (Jungle, jungle, jungle!),
I said where the living is hardest (concrete jungle!).
Concrete jungle (jungle, jungle, jungle)
Man, you got to do your best (concrete jungle!)
Wo-ooh
No chains around my feet
But I'm not free
I know I am bounded in captivity; oh now
(Never known) Never known (what happiness is) what happiness is;
(Never known) I've never known (what sweet caress is) what sweet caress is yeah
Still, I'll be always laughing like a clown; (oooh-oooh-oooh)
Oh someone help me 'cause I (sweet life) -
I've got to pick myself from off the ground (got to be, out there somewhere out there for me)
In this ya concrete jungle (Jungle, jungle, jungle!):
I said, what do you got for me (concrete jungle!) now?
Concrete jungle (jungle, jungle, jungle!), why won't you let me be (concrete jungle!) now?
Ohhh yeah
[Guitar solo]
I said that life (sweet life) must be (got to be) somewhere to be found (out there somewhere for me)
Oh, instead: concrete jungle (jungle!) - collusion (concrete jungle!) -
Confusion (confusion). Eh!
Concrete jungle (jungle!): we've made it, We've got it.
In Concrete jungle (concrete jungle!), now. Eh!
Concrete jungle (jungle, jungle, jungle!).
What, what do you got for me (jungle, jungle!) now? [fadeout]

I'd really like to make you confirm reservation
So here I am with my implication
I wanna be with my friends and family
With the living is my teasing up for me
'Cause in this town I can't take the vibe no more, oh
Could you take another day under this condition?
I'm going over to cross river Jordan
The white men lose, one day I'm gonna win
I'm going to believe where there is nothing
'Cause in this town I can't take the vibes no more
I can't take the vibe no more, oh um
Could you take another day under this condition?
I'm going over to cross river Jordan
The white men lose, one day I'm gonna win
I'm going to believe where there is nothing
'Cause in this town I can't take the vibes no more
I can't take the vibe no more, oh
Am I leaving you today?
Am I leaving you to stay?
'Cause I can't take the vibe no more
Can't take the vibe no more, oh
Turn on your feeling
Can't take the vibe no more
Wanted to believe me
Can't take the vibes no more
I'm moving on

[Bunny Wailer dialogue]
Since the beginning of modern civilization
Generations have witnessed and inherited the only conflicts of world wars
But behold the marriage supper of the lamb and the bridegroom onto his bride
Then shall the earth's children know the true expression of ONE LOVE
Then mother earth shall honeymoon in peace.
Forever eliminating the aspirations, lust and anguish of wars and rumors of wars...SELAH!
[Verse 1]
See it deh know the innocent going up in vapors 
And propoganda spreading inna the sunday papers not even superman coulda save you with him cape cause
Red-a Judgement a blaze, blaze ya
And Babylon a gamble the youth dem life like racehorse
And gi dem a uniform and a shave dem head with razors
And now the clock a strike war, don't be amazed cause

Can we do it? We can do it, we shall do it!

Wife can't get no news and lately she starting to doubt
SHE STILL SEARCHING!
And the youth dem bawling out
Working hard not to let it all come out
Well it's not safe to go walk about
A slaughterhouse from Bagdad to Waterhouse
She start to arouse sometime she want a spouse
She start go out, start beat a darker stout
GUNS COME OUT!
Working people funds run out
Keep a show last week and no one come out
BOMBS COME OUT!

If you cannot do it, if you are not prepared to do it...then you will die.
You race of cowards, you race of imbosiles, you race of good for nothings
If you cannot do what other men have done
What other nations have done, what other races have done 
Then you yourself shall die.
[Repeat Verse 1]
[Verse 3]
SEE IT DEH NOW...Hey!
Now wi fore parents sacrifice enough
Dem blood sweat and tears run like syrup
Any day a revolution might erupt, and the skys over Kingston lighting up
For the new generation rising up, of youths now a days weh dem sighting up
And through reasoning dem biding up, 
Searching for the sign and the sign is us,
Searching for the truth all you find is us,
Searching for the troops still behind is us,
The almighty we recruit and we come from the root
We build like roach building boot
Weh just can't done, Rastafari design me tuff
If a the fight for freedom sign me up
Cause you Tell-Lie-Vision can't blind me up
Soldiers and police dem wising up, realizing they're no more right than us
Realizing there's no use fighting us
Realizing their opening their eyes to see the same demoralizing life as us
So we nah tek talk nor smiling up
Cause the word temper tantrum boiling up,and who...
Calling the shots and nah bust none
Controlling the mind of the young, bring down...
Bear famine, no rain nah fall from London to Dadeland mall
All the son of the virgin bawl, institute of the church IN WAR
Preaching and researching WAR
Practice and rehearsing WAR
Teaching and dem learning WAR
Instigating and urging WAR
Always keep alert in WAR
Cause man will jump out a swerving car
Now bees and birds IN WAR
And the freaks and nerds IN WAR
And the straight and curves IN WAR
Forward and reverse IN WAR

They've been married
For seventeen years
But u can see
She don't trust him at all
And you can see she don't believe that he is not cheating
You can't blame a poor girl
He's been a busy man all his life, just like the rest of us
One day she caught him with another girl
He said it was his mother
She caught with another one
He said it was his sister
He's in deep water again
I don't know what he gonna say today but I won't be surprise
if he gets out of this one like the other ones
'Cause I know he's the Houdini
Of cheaters, hear him now when he says

Cool down baby everything is under control
It doesn't matter where I get my appetite
I will always eat at home [x2]

So far so good we still living today
But we don't know what tomorrow brings
In this crazy world
People dying like flies every day
You read about it in the news
But you don't believe it
You'll only know about it
When the man in the long black coat
Knocks on your door
'Cause you're his next victim
As you are living in this
[Chorus:]
Living in, living in this crazy world [x4]
Leaders starting wars anytime they want
Some for their rights
Some for fun and their own glory letting people die for the wrongs that they do
Oh it's painful. Come on now little boy
Say your prayers before you sleep
Little boy went down on his knees
And he said:
"Oh Lord! Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take"
'Cause he's living in this crazy world
Oh Lord

And the Word was with Jah
And the Word was Jah
In the beginning Jah created the heaven and the earth
Then he created man of his own likeness and image
Gave unto man wisdom, knowledge, overstanding
Jah is my life and my strength
So whom shall I fear
He is a shield upon my right and my left hand
Jah is my keeper
Jah is my light and my salvation
So whom shall I fear
He is my guide throughout this Creation
So whom shall I be afraid
Jah is my keeper
Jah is my guide
In my resting and my rising
So whom shall I fear
He is my guide when I step out and forward
So whom shall I be afraid
Jah is my keeper
Jah is my guide
When Philistines come down upon I
So whom shall I fear
He is my guide when my enemies come to devour I
So whom shall I be afraid
Jah is my keeper
Jah is my guide
From the pestilence of darkness
So whom shall I fear
He is my guide from the vampires of hell
So whom shall I be afraid
Jah is my keeper
Jah is my health and my strength
So whom shall I fear
He is a shield upon my right and my left hand
So whom shall I be afraid

Is it the bodyguards around you
Is it the high walls where you live
Or is it the men with the guns around you
Twenty four hours a day
That make you ignore the crying of the people
Farmers get killed everyday
And you say it is not that bad
Policemen get killed everyday
And you say it is not that bad
Maybe if you see it through the eyes
Of the victims
You will join us and fight this
[Chorus:]
Crime and corruption
Do you ever worry
About your house being broken into
Do you ever worry
About your car being taken away from you
In broad daylight
Down highway 54
Do you ever worry
About your wife becoming
The woman in black
Do you ever worry
About leaving home and
Coming back in a coffin
With a bullet through your head
So join us and fight this
[Chorus:]
Crime and corruption

They say the sun an-a shines for all,

So they making matters worse.
But no matter what the crisis is;
No matter what the crisis is:
Doin' it, doin' it, doin' your thing!
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)
Givin' it, givin' it, givin' it, givin' it!
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)
So - so - so much have been said, so little (been done) been done
They still killin' - killin' the people
And they - and they havin' (havin' their fun) - havin'-a - havin'-a lots of fun -
Killin' the people, oo-yoo! - (havin' fun) havin' their fun!
They just want to be the leader
In the 'ouse of the risin' sun.
But no matter what the crisis is;
Oh, no, oh, no no - no what the crisis is:
Do your - live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up!
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)
Live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up!

[Instrumental break]
They say the sun-un-un-un shines for all,
But-a yin some people world, it never shine at all!
They say love is a stream,
That will find its course, and every river runs to sea;
Some people still think life is a dream,
So they - so they makin' - makin' it worse.
No matter what the crisis is;
No matter what the crisis is:
Do it: live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up!
(Give Jah all the thanks and praises!)
Live it up, live it up, live it up, live it up!

His mercies endureth for ever, yeah!

Hey... I'm gonna cry, cry, cry. Set the children free
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry. Set the children free
Mommy loves to work and daddy loves to play
Sometimes daddy got to go far away
I'm too young to go quiet in the night
Try to put me to sleep I'm gonna give it a fight
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry. Set the children free
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry. Set the children free
Wake you up at 5 am
Before the sunrise I'll be your friend
And you know I don't like for you to take too long
Just come running when you hear this song
[Chorus]
Well now....I'm gonna miss you now Mr. Far Away
Paint a picture of you and send it off today
And when you come home you can bring it back to me
Color in the lines, define this whole world for me
[Chorus]
Practice makes perfect and that I agree
So don't be surprised that I want to be free
I know what I know and that's all that I know
But I been told you reap what you sow
[Chorus]
Mama's telling me what to eat today
But I don't feel like I'm gonna go that way
What I need is something sweet and nice
What I need is a treat alright
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry. Set the children free
I'm gonna cry, cry, cry. Set the children free
Set the children free. Set the children free
Set the children free
Free up their hearts, free up their minds
Set the children free
Free up their dreams and their imagination
Set the children free
Set the children free

Show me yours
I'll show you mine
Maybe mine is bigger than yours
Maybe mine goes deeper than yours
That is why I cry the most
I played your game
But I didn't know the rules
Everytime we've played
You'd come out a winner
Now I've learned to play the game
And I will never cry again
[Chorus:]
These crying games, we play
It's your turn to cry
They say the winner takes it all
But in my case, the winner didn't
Take the pain
In my case the winner didn't
Take the hurt
That is why I cry the most
I played your game
But I didn't know the rules
Everytime we've played
You'd come out a winner
Now I've learned to play the game
And I will never lose again
[Chorus:]
These crying games, we play
It's your turn to cry

If it's love that you're running from

Just your problems, no one else's problems
You just have to face
If you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Gonna walk and don't look back
Gonna walk and don't look back
Now if your first lover let you down

400 years (400 years, 400 years. Wo-o-o-o)
And it's the same -
The same (wo-o-o-o) philosophy
I've said it's four hundred years;
(400 years, 400 years. Wo-o-o-o, wo-o-o-o)
Look, how long (wo-o-o-o)
And the people they (wo-o-o-o) still can't see.
Why do they fight against the poor youth of today?
And without these youths, they would be gone -
All gone astray
Come on, let's make a move:
(make a move, make a move. Wo-o-o-o, wo-o-o-o)
I can (wo-o-o-o) see time (wo-o-o-o) - time has come,
And if-a fools don't see
(fools don't see, fools don't see. Wo-o-o-o)
I can't save the youth:
The youth (wo-o-o-o) is gonna be strong.
So, won't you come with me;
I'll take you to a land of liberty
Where we can live - live a good, good life
And be free.
Look how long: 400 years, (400 years, 400 years) -
Way too long! (wo-o-o-o)
That's the reason my people (wo-o-o-o) - my people can't see.
Said, it's four hundred long years - (400 years, 400 years. Wo-o-o-o)
Give me patience (wo-o-o-o) - same philosophy.
It's been 400 years, (400 years, 400 years)
Wait so long! Wo-o-o-o, wo-o-o-o.
How long? 400 long, long years.

Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
And where have you been my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.
Oh, what did you see, my blue eyed son?
And what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand takers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin'
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin'
I heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.
Oh, who did you meet my blue-eyed son?
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman whose body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded and hatred
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?
And what'll you do now my darling young one?
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'
I'll walk to the deepths of the deepest black forest
Where the people are a many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And I'll tell and think it and speak it and breathe it
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'
But I'll know my songs well before I start singin'
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

Affairs of the hearts
Together we’ve grown
If ever apart
All I want u to know
Is your love is life changing
And I couldn’t be the same without you darling
Your love is life saving
You always catch me when I fall
When the tour bus drop off
And all light lock off and I’m a mere mortal again
Promoter belly full and all the fans gone home
I’m glad that you’re more than a friend
Ooman your love is life changing
And I couldn’t be the same without you darling
Your love is life saving
You always catch me when I fall
There’s people just like you and me 
We pass them in the traffic
That never fall in love and so me have it say me lucky
‘nuff a dem nuh fortunate enough to have somebody
Some just cannot see beyond the flesh and its so funny
Never get too caught up in yourself to feel the magic
True love come and pass you by in life that is so tragic
Opportunity is scarce so take it while you have it
Nuh wait ‘til you a panic
Well the last man yu deh wid mek a big mistake
Lef’ an’ gone fi good and miss out something weh great
Loyal and full a faith when nuff a dem a move fake
Our ting separate we can’t separate
‘cause I would miss yu baby
And I can’t do without yu darling
Yes and I would miss yu baby
Girl yu know I love yu bad
[Chorus]
Affairs of the heart
Together we’ve grown
If things fall apart
All I want u to know
Ooman your love is life changing
And I couldn’t be the same without you darling
Your love is life saving
You always catch me when  I fall
When I’m away it’s like my songs all waste because you’re not near to hear me
If I lost my way I’d know I’d be ok ‘cus you’d be there to care me
And ooman I can see tings clearly
You genuine because you love sincerely
You never let me down not even nearly
Not even barely
Girl you know I love yu bad
Some see the laughter and don’t see the tears
Some see the courage and don’t see the fear
Some for themselves and they don’t intend to share
Some say a love and only pretend to care
Well nuff a dem a just miss congeniality
Dem pretty face and dem nah face reality
Well dem a quantity ooman yu a quality
Girl yu know I love yu bad
[Chorus]
Affairs of the heart
Together we’ve grown
If ever apart
All I want you to know
Is your love is life changing
I couldn’t be the same without you darling
Your love is life saving
You always catch me when I fall

From where I stand
I can see the world
Getting smaller and smaller
And there'll be no place
For people like you Georgie
Who still live in the past
When you couldn't do things
For yourself, you blamed it on apartheid
You blamed it on the government and everybody
Now is the time to prove yourself
If you think affirmative action
Is the way out... no way... no way.
Constitution can be changed
From time to time,
But that does not mean that
You don't need no education
We are tired of people who
Think that affirmative action is the way out
And, is another way of putting puppets
Where they don't belong
I'm so sorry Georgie
But the only way to get our economy
Strong, is to have
An educated nation
And if you think affirmative action
Is the way out... no way... no way.
[Chorus]
Education is still the key
Even though we have Affirmative action.
[Chorus: till fade]

It's our life, I and I life
All love
I'm giving it, all love
I don't, I don't know that, all love
I'm giving it, all love
I can't hold back, all love
Tonight, it's just all love, all right
All love
Don't hold back, all love
There's something happening right here
There's something happening right here
There's something happening right here
All love, all love, all love, that's what going on, all love

It's all right
[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
Said she wants my loving all night
And when she get it, she'll be all right (all right)
Said she wants my loving all night
And when she get it, she'll be all right
[Verse 1: Stephen Marley]
Now she call me on the phone and said she's home alone
And she want me to come over and her house a home
Well I gave it to her once
And I liked how she responds
Well now i'm in trouble 
Yeah
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
It seems she needs to oil her spine
Tell all a gyal toast bread can't build di putty gold mine
Need all di doctor to fish with di essential slime
She tell me she want signal di plane n' time me want slow wine
Turn on di HBO she want fi watch Showtime
Give her di cordless microphone, she want di one with line
Seem like me and young gyal ya just can't combine
So it's sour like lime
Running it down the line Mr. Muffin one timr
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
She call mi pon di I-95
How mi ah tek so long she ah wonder which car mi drive
Tired fi listen album now and she want me live
Tell me she want mi fi come knock her out till she can't revive
SO!...Ah so mi planet and di stars align
She tell me she want me know which part her hills and valley dem join
Seh she want me ride her like a Ferrari sign
Put appointment aside
Nothing can't compromise
Fi di vibes I provide
BIM!
[Solo: Stephen Marley]
She wants my loving all night
When she get it, she all right
She wants my loving all night
[Verse 4]
I shouldn't make no physical contact, tell her fi hold down and still she just can't quiet
Seh mi tek her up and tun her inna $@# maniac
Telling me dat I compliment her natural habitat
Well...it seem like she deaf or she blind
Want come step inna mi life when time she deh far behind
Want mi play her rhythm till di tape want rewind
And she nah watch no time
And she just nah resign till she see the sunshine
OK!

There is a thirst that must be quenched, for the hearts of the broken.
Verily I say amen, amen. verily I say amen, amen.
How much is that black soul? How deep is that black hole?

For the suffering to be saved, hey, we gonna to pull together!
Verily I say, time is now. Amen, amen.
Verily I say, it has begun. Amen, amen.

Verily I say, I’m the first born son. Amen, amen.

Another heartache, another heartbreak
And all those things that
I've done to make you mine
Hoping and pretending is all that I could do
Ever since my only love is true
And in the nights I keep waiting at my door
Just to see your loving face once more
Another heartache, another heartbreak
I can't count the teardrops
I've cried since you've been gone
Now hoping and pretending is all that I could do
Ever since my only love is true
And in the nights I keep waiting at my door
Just to see your loving face once more
Another heartache, another heartbreak
I can't count the teardrops
I've cried since you've been gone

Any day now
I will hear you say goodbye my love
And you'll be on your way
Then my wild, beautiful bird
You will have flown
Any day now I'll be all alone
Any day now
When your restless eyes
Meet someone new
Oh to my sad surprise
Then the blue shadows will fall
All over town
Any day now, now love will let me down
I know I shouldn't want to keep you
If you don't want to stay
Until you're gone forever
I'll keep holding on for dear life
Holding you this way
Begging you to stay
Any day now
When the clock strikes go
You'll call it off
And then my tears will flow
Then the blue shadows will fall
All over town
Any day now, now
Love will let me down
'Cause you won't be around
No, don't fly away
My beautiful bird
Don't, don't fly away
My beautiful bird
Well.. why oh why..

Oh, autumn seems to never end
The leaves are always brown
Summer seems to never tend
To ever come around
Spring times are for beginnings
When true love is found
Winters are for finishings
True love stands its grounds
Now I hear no happy songs
Birds have all gone south
Bright green pastures drying up
And plenty turn to drought
Life is full of ups and downs
The carousels of love
Good times, bad times, smiles and frowns
Don't give up.. on me
Don't give up.. on me
Time flies by while having fun
It's all gone in a wink
And now the days feel more like much
Don't know what to think
Life is full of ups and downs
The carousels of love
Good times, bad times, smiles and frowns
Don't give up.. on me
Don't give up.. on me
Time flies by while having fun
It's all gone in a wink
Now the days feel more like months
Who knows what to think?
Life is full of ups and downs
The carousel of love
Good times, bad times, smiles and frowns
Darling, don't give up.. on me
Yeh, oh.. on me
Don't give up.. on me
Don't give up.. on me

Do, do, do, do, do, oh, oh, oh
Fret not for tomorrow
'Cause I know there will be no sorrow
Don't matter what the crisis
I will be your rescue
No, I'm not going to take no for that
'Cause I know just where it's at
B for butter and T for tat
When it comes to loving someone, girl, you know
I'm in love with you
When it comes to holding and kissing
Girl, you know I'd do anything for you

Oh, oh, ba da, oh, oh ba da, oh ba da
Oh no, I just can't understand
How come you want a change of plans?
What did I do to break your heart?
Tell me the story from the start
Play it cool, oh yeah, come on baby
Oh, oh, ba da, oh, oh ba da, oh ba da
Come on and tell me why

Oh no, I just can't understand

Oh, oh, ba ya, oh, oh ba ya, oh ba ya
What did I do to break your heart?
Tell me the story from the start
Oh yeah, tell me baby, I wanna know
Oh no, I just can't understand
How come you want a change of plans?
Oh ba ya, oh, oh, ba ya
Oh ba ya, oh, oh, ba ya

Now I know that you're not smart
How you said goodbye and love yourself
Baby, don't do it
Don't break your own heart
Even though I'll give you another chance
Oh girl, even though I'll give you another chance
Now I know you know you're mistake
And you'll never try to hurt yourself again
'Cause you have done me no wrong
Baby, can't you understand
Don't you ever try to hurt yourself anymore
Oh girl, don't you try to hurt yourself anymore
Hello, my baby, oh yeah
Baby, don't do it, yeah
Now I know that you're not wise
Look how you made yourself look sad
Baby, don't do it
Don't break your own heart
Even though I'll give you another chance
Oh girl, even though I'll give you another chance
Baby, don't do it
Oh, oh, babe, baby, don't you do it
Baby, don't do it

[Junior Reid:]
Babylon..
Babylon
[Dead Prez:]
Look what they doing, despicable, inhuman
And got the nerve to say that I'm 3/5ths of a human
Babylon is in ruins, inhabited by a beast
A bloodsucker, vampire to say the least
Look at the way that they're gnashing their teeth as they feast
Fighting to get a piece, something like Ancient Greece
Permanent Halloween, Trick or Treat
We're walking like zombies out in these streets
Shackled our hands and feet, what you see, what you see?
[Stephen Marley:]
Down there in Babylon
Where transgression increaseth
There they know no love
Hopeless are the days
Hold I stead 'Fari (Jah!)
From their wicked life
Smiles upon their faces
Evil in their hearts
Oh my, oh
Oh a oh, oh I..
[Junior Reid:]
Babylon, Babylon
Babylon, Babylon
Babylon, I know me know your kingdom a go fall down
Jah will never give you the crown
Babylon, I know me know your kingdom a go fall down
Long you try fi hold Rasta down (that's right)
Babylon, I know me know your kingdom a go fall down (yeah)
Rasta nuh 'fraid of no clown
[Dead Prez:]
Babylon is a Devil inna blue dress, Satan in a suit and tie
Oppression is freedom, Heaven is Hell and the truth is a lie
They murder the youth, the police don't shoot in the sky
It's a warzone, you do what you gotta do to survive
You get suited and ride, life is hustle or starve
This is capitalism religion, money is god
America eats the young like cannibal breakfast
Wall Street is swarming with Hannibal Lecters
Crooked elections, politricks of the shitstem
Legal lynchings, modern day crucifixions
Slaves to the current conditions that we live in
More faith in the reverends than making our own heaven
It's foul, how the youth glued to the television
Ain't heard of Assata, but Twitter following Paris Hilton
It's only right we want to be more than poor and righteous but
Even the rich today can't ignore the crisis in Babylon..
[Stephen Marley:]
Oh my, oh
Oh a oh, oh I..
[Junior Reid:]
Babylon no waan fi see the youths dem wield together
All they want we do, dem waan we fight we one anedda
Dem no waan fi see [?]
Survival, we [?] to any weather
Stephen Marley, Junior Reid, Deed Prez
Stephen Marley, Junior Reid, Deed Prez
And so, from that tiem to this time
The fall of Babylon has been prophesied
And just like heaven and earth will share
Before one of these words pass away
As we speak today, Babylon persists, to fall..

Back out, this is the rout!

I went to a party the other night
They said it's gonna be right there
But when we were at the party
I was disappointed
All we could hear there was their crackadoo
All we could hear there was their shoo-bee doobee
And the music they played there
Was not good for a Rastaman
Was not good for any Jah-man - and now
I'm going back to my roots, yeah-eh
Reggae music is all that I need
I'm going back to my roots, yeah-eh
Reggae music is all that I need
I'm going back to my roots, yeah-eh
Reggae music is all that I need
Reggae is mine, reggae is mine yeah, yeah
Reggae is mine, reggae is mine yeah, yeah
Reggae is mine yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Reggae is mine, reggae is mine yeah, yeah
Reggae is mine, reggae is mine yeah, yeah
Reggae is mine yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm going back to my roots, yeah-eh
Reggae music is all that I need
I'm going back to my roots, yeah-eh
Reggae music is all that I need..

Well, I hope you understand I just gotta go back to the island
Now the day is gone and I sit alone, thinking of you, girl
What can I do without you in my life?
I guess that our guessing game just had to end that way
The hardest one to lose of all the games we played
Now the time has passed of living in a dream world
Lying to myself, can't make that scene
Of wondering if you love me or just making a fool of me
Well, I hope you understand I just gotta go back to my island
And watch the sun go down
(Sit and watch the sun go down)
Hear the sea roll in
(Listen to the sea roll in)
And I'll be thinking of you
(Yes, and I'll be thinking of you)
And how it might have been
(Thinking how it might have been)
Hear the night birds cry
(Listen to the night birds cry)
See the sunset die
(Sit and watch the sunset die)
Well, I hope you understand I just gotta go back to the island
Of all the fun we had, it's still raining in my heart
I know down in my soul I'm surely gonna miss you
But it had to end that way of all the games we played
Well, I hope you understand I just gotta go back to the island
And watch the sun go down
(Sit and watch the sun go down)
Hear the sea roll in
(Listen to the sea roll in)
And I'll be thinking of you
(Yes, and I'll be thinking of you)
And how it might have been
(Thinking how it might have been)
Hear the night birds cry
(Listen to the night birds cry)
See the sunset die
(Sit and watch the sunset die)
Well, I hope you understand I just gotta go back to the island
I got to go back, I got to go back, I got to go back, see the sunset die

The system's got too much control, and they don't wanna let it go
I'm a prisoner fighting to be free, I'm breaking out of captivity
Be free, be free
To be free
Little by little, I'm losing control
As little by little my rights erode
I stop the deputy, now you know
Mama don't try, you see I got to go
[Chorus]
The government's got too much control,
Now is there some place that we can roll
the politics of fear and oppression is everywhere now
the law is closing in, just take what you can bring
[Chorus]
The system's got too much control,
now is there some place that we can roll
I'm a prisoner fighting to be free, the law is closing in
just take what we can bring

I tried my best - never to stop love you
To be there for you, oh
You make my life so miserable
Jealousy and problems, coming to our lifes
We've been together for so long
And we've been through so much
Try to do right
But everything I do, seems to go wrong
If I didn't love you baby
I'll be long gone
I need you now, I need you to be strong
Be strong, be strong, be strong
Everytime I go out, she always accuse me
Smelling me and telling me, who's perfume is that
Why don't you trust me, you know I'm always faithfull
I'm only looking at the girl, but babs I don't touch
We've been together for so long
And we've been through so much
Try to do right
But everything I do, seems to go wrong
If I didn't love you baby
I'll be long gone
I need you now, I need you to be strong
Be strong, be strong, be strong
We've been together for so long
And we've been through so much
Try to do right
But everything I do, seems to go wrong
If I didn't love you baby
I'll be long gone
I need you now, I need you to be strong
Be strong, be strong, be strong
Oh....na..na..na...
Be strong, be strong, be strong...

On the beach in Hawaii
I wish you were here with me, walking on the beach in Hawaii
playing on the golden sand, looking at the ocean now I understand
love is like the open sea, and I wish you were here with me
on the beach in Hawaii
Since you've been gone away, I think about you everyday
don't you know I miss you much, and you know I need your touch
I'm on a rocky cliff, oh I wish you were here with me
on the beach in Hawaii
A little pakalolo, and I say mahalo
ujjayi breathing, to get a real feeling
yogi gonna let you know
that I wish you were here with me
on the beach in Hawaii
in Hawaii

Take a look into the sky
'Cause the world is not so pretty
Free myself from worries
So I can see
It's just a beautiful day
It's just a beautiful day
You could be sad
But I rather you not be
Don't dwell on the negative
Just the positivity
And it's a beautiful day
It's just a beautiful day
We're always trying to satisfy these wants and needs
Take you some time for that inner peace
When your eyes are open
You'll see things differently
There's so much gloom
Hiding the reality
It's just a beautiful day
Yeah, It's just a beautiful day
Take a look into the sky
Wake up
Take a look into the sky
Keep your head up high
Take a look into the sky
I take a look into the sky
'Cause the world is not so pretty
Free myself from worries
So I can see
It's just a beautiful day
I could be sad
But you rather me not be
Don't dwell on the negative just the positivity
And it's a beautiful day
And it's a beautiful day
We're always trying to satisfy these wants and needs
Take you some time for that inner peace
When our eyes are open
We'll see things differently
There's so much gloom
Hiding the reality
It's just a beautiful day
A beautiful day
Take a look into the sky
Wake up
Take a look into the sky
Look in the sky
Keep your head up high
It's just a beautiful day
I know it's a beautiful day
It's just a beautiful day
I know it's a beautiful day
No one can take that away
It's just a beautiful day
I know it's a beautiful day
Don't you feel no way
It's just a beautiful day

Beautiful Mother Nature
She looked at me with a smile on her face
Then she started to cry
She said why did my children forsake me
She felt like she was dying
Oh ungrateful children
When she was young she was beautiful and strong
The more children she had the more things went wrong
Now she's feeling old and cold
And her heart doesn't feel love anymore
Beautiful Mother Nature
She sat me down and told me to sing her a song
Maybe it would make her feel better
Maybe her children would sing along
And see the wrong we have done
Make amends to mend her heart
She still wouldn't hate none of her children
No matter what cruel things they've done
She'll always be there when her babies are crying
She's a mother a mother you can depend on
Beautiful Mother Nature
She's hoping her children will love her again
Like once she remember
Before skyscrapers and chemical plants
When she was all that we had
Before they polluted her sacred land
Now her tears are falling like acid rain
And her voice sounds like earthquake
I had to beg her Mother please don't leave
Give another chance I'll talk to the kids
Beautiful Mother Nature
She was my
Beautiful Mother Nature
Still is my
Beautiful Mother Nature
She is my
Beautiful Mother Nature
Still is my

Yeah, she's such a beautiful woman
And she have so many ugly men
And when she go to the market place
She'd leave all characters at home, oh
And she walk like a lady
Act like a lady, don't ask me why
But when she start her conversation
Every one of her friends just cry of shame
Sing along
Beautiful woman, beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman will drive you crazy
Look here and here comes Billy
And he's one of her ugly men
He says, "Hello, friend"
Then I began to tell the story
About this beautiful woman that I have seen
Then Billy turns to me and said
"She's like every woman, it's the same"
Then I shake my head and said
"No, let me tell you Billy, I can't believe
Every woman could be the same"
Sing along
A hey, beautiful woman, beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman will drive you crazy
Look here, here comes good ol' Sam
Come to town, met this girl, fall in love
And the girl keep driving him crazy
She just actin' like a lady for a short time
And she walk like a lady, act like a lady
Don't ask me why
I know when she get warmed up
Then she get started
Then she get crazy
She'll take off every piece of her clothes in the street
Sing along
Beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman, beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman will drive you crazy
Aha, beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman, beautiful woman
A beautiful woman, beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman will drive you crazy
Aha, beautiful woman, beautiful woman
Beautiful woman

[Verse 1]
And me and she we trampoose a lot
Several mornings she shampoos my locks
Always have my back she stand true to dat
Real type of loving, thank you for that
Yow...run barefoot without no shoes and socks
Cause she keep herself clean mi nah go catch no rash
And she love me for real mi nuh haffi have no cash
And any little thing from mi splish she splash
Yow...all this blinging it's like you forgot
Use cheddar as the bait den you recruit a rat
So we listen couple speech of Martin Luther chat
Dennis Brown, Bob Marley and some Super Cat
Yow...seem like she upside the duko shop
Cause she don't have a scratch it's only beautiful spot
When one duty start is when one duty stop
One nine to five, one five to twelve o'clock
You see me
[Chorus: Bobby Brown]
Beautiful
Here we go again
My love, you know
I will never let you go
My love
Beautiful
Here we go
[Verse 2]
And I remember when we met and we began dating
And everything was copacet' and we began mating
And then the way mi love her good, she gimme don ratings
Because mi style dem plentiful and ah nuh one way thing
And she get belly full and ah nuh pot scrapings
And the closer we become the more she gravitating
Until we buckle down and there is no escaping
Now it typically became an everyday thing
Regularly, physically communicating sexually, scientifically penetrating
Until she start spiritually resonating
Ah so mi know she real and seh she ah nuh play thing
She is the only Queen, the King is designating
And so mi seal the deal I am negotiating
I know it's kinda deep but keep on concentrating
Cause Jazzy lay di beat and I am clearly stating
[Chorus]

Every day when you're walking down the street
Everybody that you meet
Has an original point of view
And I say, "Hey!"
What a wonderful kind of day
Where you can learn to work and play
And get along with each other
You got to listen to your heart
Listen to the beat
Listen to the rhythm
The rhythm of the street
Open up your eyes
Open up your ears
Get together
And make things better

If we both believe in Reincarnation,
Maybe we will have a
Chance in the next life.
You felt something for me
And I was so deeply in love with you.
But we both said nothing
Till we ran out of time
Sometimes I cry,
I said I cry
And it's not because of the pain I feel inside
And it's not because of the hurt I feel inside
But I cry,
I said I cry
Sometimes I cry
And I remember the days
When love was so far away from me,
The only time I knew about love was
When mommy and daddy told me they loved me,
And I didn't know that today it would be
Me having got to say I love you
But I remember that
[Chorus:]
Big boys don't cry
And sometimes
I cry
I said I cry.
And it's not because of the pain I feel inside
And it's not because of the hurt I feel inside
But I cry
I see your beautiful face
Everytime I close my eyes,
You reach out for me I reach out for you
But in real life we cannot meet, Oh!
That is why I cry,
I said I cry
And it's not because of the pain I feel inside
And it's not because of the hurt I feel inside
But I cry
And I remember the days
When love was so far away from me,
The only time I heard about love was
When mommy and daddy told me they loved me,
And I didn't know that today it would be
Me having got to say I love you,
But I remember that
[Chorus]

And every day, it's just blood, sweat and tears
Burning inside of me
Every day, it's just blood, sweat and tears
Burning inside of me
Everyone's playing their game and tear
I just can't get my equal share
My woman whoa, she is so willing and able

In front of Gucci in the winter, I seen ya witcha girl
Just walkin' uh - in ya chin chilla fur
I was laid up - in the coupe back shade up
Lookin' at cha face, just pure wit no make up
A little bit a mack lip gloss, hair in a bun well done
Lookin' for a ring, I seen none
So I hopped out the coupe
In hot pursuit 
To stop and introduce

And ya diamond cluster, to much just to touch ya
Perfume down to ya structure
Think I'll wait til the 2nd night to fuck ya 
I wanna marry you, nah I'm just playin'
But we can start wit a few nights out in Malibu surfin'
Playin' up on Persian
Here's my number 
Put in ya purse and call me 
[Chorus - Barrington Levy:]
On the telephone, she heard my voice
Tell me to pick her up in my Rolls Royce
If my Rolls Royce is not wit ladies
Then girl I'm gonna take you in my Mercedes
If my Mercedes will not fill up wit the disease
Then girl I'm gonna take you in my Firebird
If Firebird cannot take the curb
Girl take your ass on the damn metro bus
[Shyne:]

My player days is over 
Well maybe not completely, but stay alarmed
Come here huss ya head on my bed
And let me get between ya legs
Lay on ya back, uh - take it from the back 
Like a bad girl suppose to, I know you like that 
Scream wake the neighbors when they sleep 
Grab the sheets witcha teeth 
Wiggle ya butt cheeks 
Quarter styles over ya body, lick you up
Treat you like a convenient store, stick you up
Take you to the balcony, pick you up
So you can look at the city, while I'm diggin' ya kitty
Then we drivin' to the sunset 
Pull over, get up on the hood ma I ain't done yet
[Chorus]
[Shyne (Barrington Levy):]

Bubble baths and showers
In a silindo sheen, sincere is what you seen 
See me flip a couple things, go to magazines
And I - I think you might be the right one whoa (the right one)
Wait press the brakes, gotta investigate
What I do know - to you it don't matter 
Whether my pockets is slim or fatter 
Whether it's BBQs or Mr.Childs platter 
Even if I slip off the success ladder
Even if the paragraphs didn't hit the charts and smash 
If my car was a train I'd a service it back

Cuz we right there, yo cardier chaunce
Just you in my arms

Breaking up, is hard to do
When you turned and you walked through that door
It hurts me sore, now
I said it hurts me sore, my darling
When you looked at me and you said, goodbye
You made me cry
I said you made me cry, my darling
So listen to me, what I say to you
Breaking up is hard to do, everybody knows
Breaking up is hard to do
And saying: If you've ever been in love
Then you'll realise just what I'm talking about
Breaking up is so.. very hard to do
It's hard to do
I cannot let you go now
'Cause my love is so strong
My love is so, strong
I said my love is so, so strong
And if you leave I will surely cry
Breaking up is hard to do
Breaking up is hard to do, everybody knows
Breaking up is hard to do
Breaking up is hard to do
Breaking up is hard to do..

Can't blame you when you're going
This is something you've got to do
You've got to go, ho ho
You've got to go, ho ho
Trying so hard not to cry
Since they say a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears keep running from my eyes
I remember the day I came to the city
My children were crying
My wife was scared she's gonna lose me
To the girls in the city
To make her feel alright
I said it's impossible
To make her feel alright
I said it's impossible
But I was wrong
Can't blame you when you're going
This is something you've got to do
You've got to go, ho ho
Can't blame you when you're going
This is something you've got to do
You've got to go, ho ho
You've got to go, ho ho
You've been keeping me here
All these years
As your private lover
Letters came from home
But I never answered
'Til tonight when I got this letter
From my little daughter saying
"Missing you daddy"
It's time to go
Can't blame you when you're going
This is something you've got to do
You've got to go, ho ho
You've got to go, ho ho
Can't blame you when you're going
This is something you've got to do
You've got to go, ho ho
You've got to go, ho ho
Letters came from home
But I never answered
'Til today when I got this letter
From my little daughter saying
"Missing you daddy"
See me now, see me no more
I heard that whistle blow
I knew it's time to go
Sitting here in this train
Going so fast past the trees
I'm thinking of words to apologize
'Cause sorry ain't enough
Can't blame you when you're going
This is something you've got to do
You've got to go, ho ho
You've got to go, ho ho

Told me you loved me
Right from the start
Don't play no tricks
Don't break my heart
Told me you loved me
And I said why
You think I'm gonna cry
[Chorus:]
Can't you see
What you're doing to me
I am bound
You've got to set me free
You jerk on my heart
Shatter my brain
If you have conscience
Ain't that a shame
Told me you loved me
To make my cry
And I said I don't know why
[Chorus]
Then if you love me
Don't treat me so bad
I could give you something you never had
See you sitting up there
And you're looking so mad
Your imagination is making you sad

Have gone astray
So much careless Ethiopians
Have gone away
Hey, hey
They calling up an Antichrist
Each night and day
Pray for a God to come from outer space
So much careless Ethiopians
Have gone astray
So much careless Ethiopians
Have lost their way
Are you coming my way?
Are you coming my way?
I said I wonder what you do
You gotta come my way
Come my way
Is they know not where they're going?
They've gone astray

I can't believe that it's real
The way that she makes me feel
Its something deep down inside
Oh it's a feeling I just cannot hide
She's never been unfaithful to me
So we will always be
She's never been unfaithful to me
As far as I can see
She gave me love in the morning and in the evening too
She gave me love in when I'm lonely so I never felt blue
So ride on Cassandra ride on ride on ride on
Ride on Cassandra ride on ride on ride on

At the top of the world
Some people have nothing but just a life
Problems are there left and right
Liars, cheaters, politicians and black stabbers
Making life a little bit more unbearable
It is a give or take world
So you got to take what you can when you can
Make the best of it. Wo!
[Chorus:]
Say yeah! Celebrate life
Say year! Life is good.
We're living in the world
With demented people
There's a man standing on the edge of the bridge
Ready to end it all
Some people don't know what life is worth
Some people have the front row seat at the gates of hell
You could be having problems right now
But there's no problem worth your life
People fight to stay alive every day
Cause they know, life is worth more than worries.
So you got to take what you can when can
Make the best of it, Wo! Ho! Wo! Ho!
[Chorus: till fade]
Say Yeah, yeah celebrate life
Say Yeah, yeah life is good.

Hey, Celia, Celia

And now I come back home
The woman I left in charge of my house
Has gone with everything
She took my pop, she took my plates
She took my knife and fork
And everything that's necessary
She's gone with everything

Changes, changes, yeah
For ordinary people now
Changes, changes, yes
For ordinary people now
There's so much beauty in every breath that we take
Oh, won't you tell me, can you relate?
Needs of the many, the wants of the few
We can find religion in the freedom we choose
There's so much hurt all over the place
Oh, can't you tell by the look on my face?
And there's one thing that I must convey
Changes, changes, yeah
For ordinary people now, yeah
Changes, changes, yeah
For ordinary people now
I just can't help the way that I feel
We all want our dreams to be real
Yet circumstances that I just can't understand
Why does money got to make the man?
Everyone has an ego to feed
And every want is filled with greed
So here's one thing that I've got to say
Changes, changes, yeah, yeah
For ordinary people now
Yeah, changes, changes
For ordinary people now, y'all
Change for the better and not for the worse
Let's stand together and break our curses
We look off in the distance chasing dreams
But the things that I see with my eye's obscene
Let's plant a new tree, make a change
Need it for you and me, brighter days
Will come and you'll see, make the change
Necessary for ordinary people
There's so much beauty in every breath that we take
Oh, tell me, can you relate?
Needs of the many and the wants of the few
You can find religion in the freedom you choose
There's so much hurt all over the place
And I can tell by the look on your face
And there's one thing that we've got to say
Changes, changes
(Danny man say, brighten up your day and never feel no weight)
For ordinary people now
(Hear what we say, hear what we say)
Changes, changes
(Brighten up your day and don't feel no weight)
For ordinary people now
(Do you hear what we say? Do you hear what we say?)
Changes, changes
(Brighten up your day and don't feel no weight)
For ordinary people now
(Can you hear what we say? Hear what we say)
Changes, changes
(Brighten up your day, ain't gonna feel no pain)
For ordinary people now

Now that the change has come
We must have some fun
Now that the change has come
We must have some fun
Watching the kids playing on the lawn
They're looking gay as the bright sun shines
Nothing to worry about, nothing at all
'Cause now the change is here
Now that the change has come
We'll be praying all day long
Now that the change has come
We'll unite and live as one
We'll stop fussing and fighting among ourselves
'Cause now we have seen the light
Nothing to worry about, nothing at all
'Cause now the change is here
We'll stop fussing and fighting among ourselves
'Cause now we have seen the light
Nothing to worry about, nothing at all
'Cause now the change is here
Now that the change has come
We'll be praying all day long
Now that the change has come
We'll unite and live as one
Now that the change has come
We'll be praying all day long
Now that the change has come
We'll be praying all day long

Old man sitting by the side of the road
He's not watching the birds today
He's not watching the sunset like he always does
He's looking at the future
He has seen the past
School boy passes by interrupts his thoughts
He said sir, can you spare me a dollar
I got to make in time for my grade 8 class
I am fresh out of cigarettes
And I can't be late
The old man said
[Chorus:]
The world is changing
Take your time, look around
Make the right decision
He has no crystal ball
But he sees the future
Doesn't like what he sees, but what can he do
Little girl passes by with a baby in her arms
He thinks it's her mother's
But no, it is her own
She's only twelve years old for crying out loud
With his trembling finger
He wipes away the tears
If this is the future, he doesn't wanna be part of it
[Chorus:]
The world is changing
Take a time, look around
Make the right decision
Old man sitting by the side of his bed.
When he goes to sleep tonight
He won't have no sweet dreams
He'll be haunted by ghosts from the future
Welcome to the future.

Sitting by the door
One morning
Looking at the children going to school man, then I thought about the ones in the street
Moving up and down
No where to go
No education
No future
Then I thought about their parents man, why do they suffer so much
If they have parents why
(if you really don't want no children why do you have them, why) [x2]
[Chorus:]
We can fight and overcome
We can stop children from the street[x3]
It's a cold winter man, moving bare footed down in the street man
His father is relaxing in the best bar in town asking them to fill his glass man
His mother is kissing on another man
If you really don't want no children, why do you have them
If you can't care for them why...
[Chorus till fade]

Danny got of yellow school bus
Looking so sad today, you see it on his face
Mommy and Daddy have been fighting again
Every time they fight, he's caught in the middle of it all
He has dreams, like every little boy in the world.
But right now his main dream,
Is to get out of here.
Is to see Mommy and Daddy disappear forever.
He doesn't wanna hear those angry voices anymore
Danny, be careful what you wish for
You might just get it.
Be careful O! Oh! Oh!
[Chorus:]
You can choose your friend, but you cannot
Choose, who you related to.
He goes up to his room, he's not feeling good today
But it's no use, telling, nobody listens here
No use complaining, nobody cares around here
Little boys go to sleep and pray
For toys and candy, he prays for one thing
God I need a miracle down here
Will you make, Mommy and Daddy?
Disappear forever
Danny, be careful what you wish for
You might just, get it.
Be careful Oh! Oh! Oh!
[Chorus:]
You can choose your friend, but you cannot
Choose, who you related to.

No, no, no, no, no, no! No, Dread, no!
Would you make the system make you kill your brotherman?

Would you make the system get on top of your head again?

[Chorus:]
Coming In Hot
Firin' some shot
Coming in red hot
It's a musical shot
I just clean up me nuzzle
I just load me barrel
And I cock me hammer
Cause I'm gonna pull my trigger
[Chorus]
One minute after dozing
I thought that I was a blazing
My blood it was a boiling
It was amazing
[Chorus]
Next day it went higher
Whole a me catch a fire
I couldn't take it no longer
I haffe chokin' on some cold ice water
[Chorus]
I got up the other day
My heat it never went away
103 on the hour
I had to head for the shower
[Chorus]

Holy holy, hmm, holy holy
It started settle down in the drag to concentrate
And getting a weekly pay instead of begging every day
Father gave us every little thing to make us try
And help ourselves and He said He'd help those
Who try to help their selves
So if you want to be in that situation
Change your evil ways and join this congregation
And maybe you'll soon be living like the King
That sitteth on His throne
If happiness is far away, it will show up some day
Holy holy, holy holy
If you want to live that independent life
Go out and do the work instead of being in a fight
Father knows that you're the chosen one
To perform His works
And you'll be repaid in His holy way
In His holy way, yeah, yeah
In His holy way, yeah, holy way, yeah, holy way

No sun will shine in my day today (no sun will shine)
The high yellow moon won't come out to play (that high yellow moon won't come out to play)
I said (darkness) darkness (has come and covered my light) has covered my light,
(And has changed)
And has changed (my day into night) my day into night, yeah.
Where is the love to be found? (ooh-ooh-ooh)
Won't someone tell me 'cause
Life (sweet life) must be (got to be) somewhere to be found (out there somewhere out there for me)
Instead of concrete jungle (Jungle, jungle, jungle!),
I said where the living is hardest (concrete jungle!).
Concrete jungle (jungle, jungle, jungle)
Man, you got to do your best (concrete jungle!)
Wo-ooh
No chains around my feet
But I'm not free
I know I am bounded in captivity; oh now
(Never known) Never known (what happiness is) what happiness is;
(Never known) I've never known (what sweet caress is) what sweet caress is yeah
Still, I'll be always laughing like a clown; (oooh-oooh-oooh)
Oh someone help me 'cause I (sweet life) -
I've got to pick myself from off the ground (got to be, out there somewhere out there for me)
In this ya concrete jungle (Jungle, jungle, jungle!):
I said, what do you got for me (concrete jungle!) now?
Concrete jungle (jungle, jungle, jungle!), why won't you let me be (concrete jungle!) now?
Ohhh yeah
[Guitar solo]
I said that life (sweet life) must be (got to be) somewhere to be found (out there somewhere for me)
Oh, instead: concrete jungle (jungle!) - collusion (concrete jungle!) -
Confusion (confusion). Eh!
Concrete jungle (jungle!): we've made it, We've got it.
In Concrete jungle (concrete jungle!), now. Eh!
Concrete jungle (jungle, jungle, jungle!).
What, what do you got for me (jungle, jungle!) now? [fadeout]

I'd really like to make you confirm reservation
So here I am with my implication
I wanna be with my friends and family
With the living is my teasing up for me
'Cause in this town I can't take the vibe no more, oh
Could you take another day under this condition?
I'm going over to cross river Jordan
The white men lose, one day I'm gonna win
I'm going to believe where there is nothing
'Cause in this town I can't take the vibes no more
I can't take the vibe no more, oh um
Could you take another day under this condition?
I'm going over to cross river Jordan
The white men lose, one day I'm gonna win
I'm going to believe where there is nothing
'Cause in this town I can't take the vibes no more
I can't take the vibe no more, oh
Am I leaving you today?
Am I leaving you to stay?
'Cause I can't take the vibe no more
Can't take the vibe no more, oh
Turn on your feeling
Can't take the vibe no more
Wanted to believe me
Can't take the vibes no more
I'm moving on

[Bunny Wailer dialogue]
Since the beginning of modern civilization
Generations have witnessed and inherited the only conflicts of world wars
But behold the marriage supper of the lamb and the bridegroom onto his bride
Then shall the earth's children know the true expression of ONE LOVE
Then mother earth shall honeymoon in peace.
Forever eliminating the aspirations, lust and anguish of wars and rumors of wars...SELAH!
[Verse 1]
See it deh know the innocent going up in vapors 
And propoganda spreading inna the sunday papers not even superman coulda save you with him cape cause
Red-a Judgement a blaze, blaze ya
And Babylon a gamble the youth dem life like racehorse
And gi dem a uniform and a shave dem head with razors
And now the clock a strike war, don't be amazed cause
inna dem churches tryin to save...saviours
[Marcus Garvey dialogue 1]
Can we do it? We can do it, we shall do it!

Boom! 
Tell dem fe uh draw mi out when the world government inna falling out
Only few men survive crawling out

And give him two tranquilizer fi stall him out
DEH PON BASE!
Can't get no calling out when him hear from the shout last week
Him mistress find a new shoes
Wife can't get no news and lately she starting to doubt
SHE STILL SEARCHING!
And the youth dem bawling out
Working hard not to let it all come out
Well it's not safe to go walk about
A slaughterhouse from Bagdad to Waterhouse
She start to arouse sometime she want a spouse
She start go out, start beat a darker stout
GUNS COME OUT!
Working people funds run out
Keep a show last week and no one come out
BOMBS COME OUT!
Mi gas tank just run out

[Marcus Garvey dialogue 2]
If you cannot do it, if you are not prepared to do it...then you will die.
You race of cowards, you race of imbosiles, you race of good for nothings
If you cannot do what other men have done
What other nations have done, what other races have done 
Then you yourself shall die.
[Repeat Verse 1]
[Verse 3]
SEE IT DEH NOW...Hey!
Now wi fore parents sacrifice enough
Dem blood sweat and tears run like syrup
Any day a revolution might erupt, and the skys over Kingston lighting up
For the new generation rising up, of youths now a days weh dem sighting up
And through reasoning dem biding up, 
Searching for the sign and the sign is us,
Searching for the truth all you find is us,
Searching for the troops still behind is us,
The almighty we recruit and we come from the root
We build like roach building boot
Weh just can't done, Rastafari design me tuff
If a the fight for freedom sign me up
Cause you Tell-Lie-Vision can't blind me up
Soldiers and police dem wising up, realizing they're no more right than us
Realizing there's no use fighting us
Realizing their opening their eyes to see the same demoralizing life as us
So we nah tek talk nor smiling up
Cause the word temper tantrum boiling up,and who...
Calling the shots and nah bust none
Controlling the mind of the young, bring down...
Bear famine, no rain nah fall from London to Dadeland mall
All the son of the virgin bawl, institute of the church IN WAR
Preaching and researching WAR
Practice and rehearsing WAR
Teaching and dem learning WAR
Instigating and urging WAR
Always keep alert in WAR
Cause man will jump out a swerving car
Now bees and birds IN WAR
And the freaks and nerds IN WAR
And the straight and curves IN WAR
Forward and reverse IN WAR

They've been married
For seventeen years
But u can see
She don't trust him at all
And you can see she don't believe that he is not cheating
You can't blame a poor girl
He's been a busy man all his life, just like the rest of us
One day she caught him with another girl
He said it was his mother
She caught with another one
He said it was his sister
He's in deep water again
I don't know what he gonna say today but I won't be surprise
if he gets out of this one like the other ones
'Cause I know he's the Houdini
Of cheaters, hear him now when he says

Cool down baby everything is under control

Could you be loved and be loved?

Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved, wo now! - and be loved?

So while you point your fingers someone else is judging you)
Love your brotherman
(Could you be - could you be - could you be loved?

Could you be - could you be - could you be loved?
Could you be - could you be loved?)
Don't let them change ya, oh
Or even rearrange ya! Oh, no
We've got a life to live
They say: only - only
Only the fittest of the fittest shall survive
Stay alive! Eh
Could you be loved and be loved?
Could you be loved, wo now! - and be loved?

So far so good we still living today
But we don't know what tomorrow brings
In this crazy world
People dying like flies every day
You read about it in the news
But you don't believe it
You'll only know about it
When the man in the long black coat
Knocks on your door
'Cause you're his next victim
As you are living in this
[Chorus:]
Living in, living in this crazy world [x4]
Leaders starting wars anytime they want
Some for their rights
Some for fun and their own glory letting people die for the wrongs that they do
Oh it's painful. Come on now little boy
Say your prayers before you sleep
Little boy went down on his knees
And he said:
"Oh Lord! Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take"
'Cause he's living in this crazy world
Oh Lord
[Chorus: till fade]

In the beginning was the Word
And the Word was with Jah
And the Word was Jah
In the beginning Jah created the heaven and the earth
Then he created man of his own likeness and image
Gave unto man wisdom, knowledge, overstanding
Jah is my life and my strength
So whom shall I fear
He is a shield upon my right and my left hand
Jah is my keeper
Jah is my light and my salvation
So whom shall I fear
He is my guide throughout this Creation
So whom shall I be afraid
Jah is my keeper
Jah is my guide
In my resting and my rising
So whom shall I fear
He is my guide when I step out and forward
So whom shall I be afraid
Jah is my keeper
Jah is my guide
When Philistines come down upon I
So whom shall I fear
He is my guide when my enemies come to devour I
So whom shall I be afraid
Jah is my keeper
Jah is my guide
From the pestilence of darkness
So whom shall I fear
He is my guide from the vampires of hell
So whom shall I be afraid
Jah is my keeper
Jah is my health and my strength
So whom shall I fear
He is a shield upon my right and my left hand
So whom shall I be afraid
Jah is my keeper

Is it the bodyguards around you
Is it the high walls where you live
Or is it the men with the guns around you
Twenty four hours a day
That make you ignore the crying of the people
Farmers get killed everyday
And you say it is not that bad
Policemen get killed everyday
And you say it is not that bad
Maybe if you see it through the eyes
Of the victims
You will join us and fight this
[Chorus:]
Crime and corruption
Do you ever worry
About your house being broken into
Do you ever worry
About your car being taken away from you
In broad daylight
Down highway 54
Do you ever worry
About your wife becoming
The woman in black
Do you ever worry
About leaving home and
Coming back in a coffin
With a bullet through your head
So join us and fight this
[Chorus:]
Crime and corruption

Paint a picture of you and send it off today
And when you come home you can bring it back to me

Practice makes perfect and that I agree
So don't be surprised that I want to be free
I know what I know and that's all that I know
But I been told you reap what you sow
[Chorus]
Mama's telling me what to eat today
But I don't feel like I'm gonna go that way
What I need is something sweet and nice

Show me yours
I'll show you mine
Maybe mine is bigger than yours
Maybe mine goes deeper than yours
That is why I cry the most
I played your game
But I didn't know the rules
Everytime we've played
You'd come out a winner
Now I've learned to play the game
And I will never cry again
[Chorus:]
These crying games, we play
It's your turn to cry
They say the winner takes it all
But in my case, the winner didn't
Take the pain
In my case the winner didn't
Take the hurt
That is why I cry the most
I played your game
But I didn't know the rules
Everytime we've played
You'd come out a winner
Now I've learned to play the game
And I will never lose again
[Chorus:]
These crying games, we play
It's your turn to cry

Let me take you there, I'll take you there

Breaking those barriers
All over the world
Was not an easy thing
Yesterday your mouth was shut yeah
Couldn't make a sound eh boy
But it's such a good feeling today
When I can hear them from
Across the ocean singing this song
That the whole world should be singing
All the time
[Chorus: x3]
We're...
Different colours {one people}
Different colours {one people}
Hey you government
Never try to seperate the people
Hey you politician
Never try to seperate the people
They were created in the image of God
And who are you to seperate them
Bible says, he made man in his image
But it didn't say black or white
Look at me you see BLACK
I look at you I see WHITE
Now is the time to kick that away
And join me in my song
[Chorus: x3]
Hey you politician
Never seperate the people here
Hey you man hey you man
Never try to seperate the people
Some were from America
We were from South Africa
Some were from Japan
We were from China
Some were from Australia
We were from the U.K.
Some were from Zimbabwe
We were from Ghana
Some were from Jamaica
We were from Russia
Some were from Aha-ha-ha
We were from Uhu-hu-hu
[Chorus: till fade] 

Dilly dally, dilly dally, dilly dally
Then you're gonna be late
If you dilly dally, dilly dally, dilly dally
Then you're gonna be late
If you dilly dally, dilly dally, dilly dally
Then you're gonna be late
If you dilly dally, dilly dally, dilly dally
Then you're gonna be late
You heard me say love all the way
And I will prove love all the way
So don't dilly dally
Oh don't dilly dally
I tell you now don't dilly dally
Keep on telling don't dilly dally
If you wait a little, wait a little, wait a little
Then you're gonna be late
If you wait a little, wait a little, wait a little
Then you're sure to be late
If you dilly dally, dilly dally, dilly dally
Then you're gonna be late
If you dilly dally, dilly dally, dilly dally
Then you're gonna be late
You heard me say love all the way
And I will prove, prove love all the way
If you dilly dally, dilly dally, dilly dally
Then you're gonna be late
If you dilly dally, dilly dally, dilly dally
Then you're gonna be late
If you wait a little, wait a little, wait a little
Then you're gonna be late
If you wait a little, wait a little, wait a little
Then you're sure to be late
I tell you don't dilly dally
Don't dilly dally

It seems like it only happened yesterday
Now that I think about it
Tears cannot bring you joy
But joy can bring you tears
Even though I cry today
I will not hide it
It is for a different reason - joy
That is why I'll shout it out
For the world to hear
I say hello, hello happiness
Oh Jah, thank you
For another day, I say
[Chorus:]
Ding ding licky licky licky bong [x3]
Another tear drop falls
But I don't care
I took a wrong turn in life before
But I've paid my dues
Objects in the rear view mirror
They appear closer than they are
If you don't talk the talk
Don't walk the walk
If you won't please, don't tease
Another lesson learned
I'm gonna shout it out again
Hello, hello happiness
Oh God, thank you
For another chance
There is no future in the past
So shout it out...

It is not the 4th of July
But we're celebrating Mr. BB and Mrs. BB have decided to call it a day
After so many years, living together
They have called us here today
To witness what they call freedom from each other
They've been living in style, they wanna end it in style
They wanna end it with a bang.
[Chorus:]
Divorce party, divorce party
We see them now
In the middle of the room
Holding glasses so high
They not renewing their sacred vows, not at all
But they're telling everybody
What they didn't like about each other
One says, do you remember that day I said that
Do you remember that day [x2] you did that
I hope our paths will never meet again

You know that I love you,
Baby, but you just won't let me.
You know that I love you,
Baby, but you just won't let me.
Every morning I get up, I sip my cup;
My eyes get red, no-one to hear me.
One more thing I'd like to say right here,
Baby, but you just won't let me.
One more thing I'd like to say right here,
Baby, but you just won't let me.
I'd like to say: baby, you so nice:
I'd like to do the same thing twice, yeah!
Baby, you so nice.
I'd like to do the same thing twice.
I love you so much, so-o-o-
Love you - love you, baby, so much.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I live in the woods alone;
I need your (company) company.
Baby! Woods alone!
I need your company, yeah!
Every morning I get up, I sip my cup;
My eyes get red, no-one to hear me.
One more thing I'd like to say right here,
Baby, but you just won't let me, yeah!
One more thing I'd like to say right here,
Baby, but you just won't let me.
I'd like to say: baby, you so nice:
Do the same thing twice, yeah!
Baby, you so nice;
I'd like to do the same thing twice;
I love you, baby, so much.

Well, well, well, yeah - oooh
Sittin' in the mornin' sun
I'll be sittin' till the evenin' come
Watching the ships roll in, yea!
Then I watch 'em roll away again, Lord
I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooh, sittin' on the dock of the bay, wastin' time
I left my home in Jamaica
Headed for London town
I have nothing to live for
Looks like nothin's gonna come my way
Lord, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooh, sittin' on the dock of the bay, wastin' time
Looks like nothing's gonna change
Everything still remains the same, woo
I can't do what some people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, Lord!
Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone, yea
Three thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this London my home
Lord, I'm just gonna sit at the dock of the bay
Just to make this London my home, Lord
I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooh, sittin' on the dock of the bay, wastin' time

Everytime I say I wanna go
I can tell you gonna cry
Everytime I say I wanna go
I can tell you gonna cry
Thinking of the lonely nights
(When I'm not there)
Thinking of the days
(When I've gone)
Thousands of people
Wanna see me
Millions are waiting
For the message
Billions are dying
For the message
I am going round the world
Spreading the message
I am going round the world
Spreading the word
Don't cry baby, don't cry
[Chorus:]
Don't cry
They wanna hear me saying!
Ayobayo
They wanna hear me hear me say
I've got you babe
They wanna hear me sayin
Together as one
They wanna hear me say
I'm a slave

Don't feel no way
Let Jah music play
Don't feel no way
Let Jah music play
Oh mister D.J. music is
The love of my life
If the day should ever come
When music stop playing
I don't want to be around
So don't feel no way
Let Jah music play
Don't feel no way
Let Jah music play
When I'm feeling
Down and out
Music is my only relief
And if you can't dig the score
Come on and brutalise my very soul
Don't feel no way
Feel no way
Oh loving music
Without you in my life
Love wouldn't worth a dime
And oh its such a crime
Love you in the morning
I love you in the evening too
I love you right next to the
Almighty one
Mister music
Let Jah music play
Hit me with music
You know I can't refuse it
Don't feel no way

Don't go nowhere
Oh, can't you see
That I still care
And my love it is strong
With all of my heart I do
With all of my breath I say
Wanting to see you
Each and everyday
Some good things are gone
Some are on their way
And I'm telling you
I'm begging you
Please stay
Don't go nowhere
Oh, can't you see
That I still care
My love yes it strong
Speak no word
Utter no sound

Can come true wsith only one
Don't go nowhere

No way

You're really sweet like cherry pie
Yeah you got me spinning and I don't know what to do
So please don't let no one tell you that I'm not in love with you because I love you deep down in the bottom of my heart
Did anyone tell you that I've been seeing someone new
Baby let me tell you
Darling please don't don't you believe
If you just come to me our hearts will beat as one
So please don't let no one tell you that I'm not in love with you because I love you deep down in the bottom of my heart
My darling, when I look into your face darling darling... All I can see

Is pure teardrops falling from your eyes
I want you to understand that I love no one but you
So please don't let no one tell you that I'm not in love with you because I love you deep down in the bottom of my heart

If it's love that you're running from
There is no hiding place
Just your problems, no one else's problems
You just have to face
If you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Gonna walk and don't look back
Gonna walk and don't look back
Now if your first lover let you down
There's something that can be done
Don't kill your faith in love
Remembering what's become
If you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Gonna walk and don't look back
Gonna walk and don't look back
If you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
We gonna walk and don't look back
Gonna walk and don't look back
Places behind you
There to remind you
If your first lover broke your heart
There's something that can be done
Gonna heal your faith in love
Remembering what's been done
But if you just put your hand in mine
We're gonna leave all our troubles behind
Gonna walk and don't look back
Gonna walk and don't look back

Leaving out all the things that we have felt
Where was I, where was I before you came
From the first time that I saw you
I thought, that maybe I...
Maybe I did something wrong
How I tried
But the words won't fit the song
Found the door
But I could not find the key
From the first time that I saw you
I thought that you may be
So don't throw it all away
I don't wanna be the one who's gonna have to beg you stay
I don't wanna be the one to change your mind
One more time
Please stay, don't throw it all away
Though it seems, that I'm just taking it out on you
Don't you know, only you can get me through
Found the door, now I know that you're the key
and from the first time that I saw you..I knew that you may be
So don't throw it all away
I don't wanna be the one who's gonna have to beg you stay

During the day he's my friend
But when the night falls
He's no friend of mine
During the day he's my friend
But when the night falls
He's nobody friend
His eyes shine wild with fire
His heart is cold as ice
I am scared of him
He lives on human blood
He feeds on human flesh
Stay away he's got no mercy
No mercy at all

[Bunny Wailer]
Hear this
Three monkeys sitting under a coconut tree (really?)
Discussing things as they are said to be
Said one to the others, now listen you two
There's a strange rumor that can't be true
They say man was ascended from our noble race
But the very idea is a big disgrace
No monkey ever deserted his wife
Or her baby, to ruin their lives
Yeah
The monkeys drift is mine (that's right)
[Chorus]
[Damian Marley]
Well educated fools they have ruined di world
And start make it hard for both di boys and di girls

And start bank it up inna federal reserves

Now dem hear the kick drum di snare and di hi hat

Surround dem ends wid all some burning tires
Round up dem friends and put dem pon trials
Until dem send di reparation dollars

Di whole a dem a go down inna flames and fires
Well unno better fly out like some frequent fliers
Bound to feel the wrath of di real Bongonyahs
Hey don't fuck yourself next time you read out di budget
Di government case, ah poor people a judge it
Dem bring di guns but di youths dem ah bust it
Bun dem skeletons weh lock up inna closet
Wipe out dem species and all dem inhabits 
With a warm series of pain and havoc
Nah clean no feces fi money prefer grab it
Dem mek mi resort to violence di race get lead up
Somebody nah live up somebody goin dead up 
BLOW!! Whole ah di garment dem red up

Gun nozzle bend up
Releasing di whole of di youth dem weh pen up

[Treach]
Well I heard that man came from sands and other molecules
Way before bodies and barbecues
With a good side a bad side and still argue too
Before schemin and thievin and dreamin of gleamin and feenin
Even before Adam and Eve and even 
Before it was about being the nicest or whose diamonds that are priceless
B.C. around Tutankhamun and Isis
On the continent of Africa
Pass out and tribes to create a character sold us shit
On earth was magical
Then the strangers came from the boat with the ropes
Chains that felt strange, they called it the slave game
The game changed
They had shackled like assholes
The Bloodclaat
So now a days the way prevent it is a thugs glock
Seen them rape and kill our children and women, the villain
The bill gon sort the black man how to kill men
Let's keep it real man
You can't harm me or scar me
Respect for me 
History's priority with the Marleys

Uncle Sam is a naughty old man
He says he wants you but he only wants to use you
He has a woman named Elizabeth she walk the streets selling her body for Glory, immorality
They get drunk from the blood of saints not the kind that are made into statues
Her brother john drinks wine all day he and his friends trying to take our souls away
Oh it's sad to say but uncle sam is gonna have his day they will weep for Elizabeth

Ever since they were born
She was worried about their friends
Even when they turned twenty five
She was worried about the company they'd keep
One day it was three in the morning
The door bell rang
She got up in a sweat
Blue lights flashing everywhere
The boys in blue standing at the door
The look on their faces scared her enough
Before they told her what she was always afraid of
[Chorus:]
Do you know where your son/daughter is tonight
I'm afraid they won't be coming home tonight
Ever since she was brought to this home
She's been cursing every woman with a child
She says they brought to this world the curse
That have stained the good name of mankind
One day it was three in the morning
The guard came running to tell us she's gone
Blue lights flashing everywhere
All over again
The boys in blue, looking for her
The look on their faces
Scared us enough when they told us to strengthen our family ties
[Chorus:]
Do you know where your mother/father is tonight
I'm afraid they won't be coming home tonight

I wake up early one morning
Then I went down to Spanish Town
To look for a friend of mine who called seminaya
Then we started to have a little talk about everything
About the situation
And this is what he said
He told me famine famine famine
Famine on the land
I said the cost of living getting so high high high
Then I trod down to Old Harbour to look for my brother John
To ask him how is life and things and things and things
Then we started to have a little talk about everything
About the situation
And this is what he said
He told me famine famine famine
Famine on the land
I said the cost of living getting so high high high
Really so high high high
So sky high
I said the situation is getting so high high high
Then I trod down to Clarendon to look for my family
Into a little district called Treadlight
That's where I was born
And we started to have a little talk together together
About the situation
And this is what they said
They told me famine famine famine
Famine on the land
I said the cost of living getting so high high high
Really so high high high
So sky high
I said this cost of living getting so high high high
Getting so high

Now far beyond the valley
Lies my destination
And when I get there
There'll be no more of this situation
'Cause, how could I ever live this life alone?
With no one to call my very own
I'll pack my bags and start off on my roam
'Cause someday I'll know I'll reach back home
And joy bells will be ringing
Children will be singing
Things will be so thrilling
Just as long as your heart is willing
'Cause, how could I ever live this life alone?
With no one to call my very own
I'll pack my bags and start off on my roam
'Cause someday I'll know I'll reach back home

Things will be so thrilling
Just as long as your heart is willing

I'm the keeper of the flame
And everybody knows his name
I'm the keeper of the flame
But nobody know his pain
I'm the keeper of the flame
And everybody know his name
I'm the keeper of the flame
Deeds are fruits
Words are but leaves
It's better to do well than to say well indeed
So if you come from the rock
Please don't run from the rock
Keep your conscious clean and put the wave upon your back
A fool is filder leaves out the common stone
But every dart feels like a lion in his home
My destiny is in my own hands
Cause the child is the father of the man so
I'm the keeper of the flame
And everybody knows his name
I'm the keeper of the flame
But nobody know his pain
I'm the keeper of the flame
And everybody know his name

Boy charter 911 before the world trade
I saw the world through Ray Charles shades

Nostradamus saw the bird's now there's two thing's missing
Two sons sitting Hussein's son sitting so calm they father Saddam hung in a prison
I'll be damned if a man put a tech in my hand have me in the sand shooting at the ground man
Runner becomes the gunner and the gun will become the hunted the hunted become the hunted on America's most wanted
How does America's most wanted get apprehended
When his man turns state on his co defendant
You need a lawyer let me talk for you
You in a wheelchair blood let me walk for you
I'm a leader
I'm the keeper of the flame
And everybody knows his name
I'm the keeper of the flame
But nobody know his pain
I'm the keeper of the flame
And everybody know his name

Yeah yeah yeah what if Martin Luther stayed in the room never step foot in the balcony
What if they had a bullet proof car instead of a drop top for Kennedy
Malcolm did the speech [?] congregation
So when them boys come get yo hands outta pocket
Five shots of the assassins Ragga
Ain't nothing new under the sun
What if I had put blanks in Marvin Gaye's firer’s gun
What if you all knew the truth before sending your kids to war
Told ya that man ain't care about Iraq
He cared about the oil
When your thinking about how many records you gonna sell
I think about getting all my people out the cell
We put in work ya’ll ain't revolutionary cause you gotta a Che Guevara T-shirt
It's just a T-shirt
Ragga why you think I ran for president
I got 5 cribs and they said I got no residence
They tried to punk me but I was born with no fear
So I'm a run it like 10 years
I'm the keeper of the flame
And everybody knows his name
I'm the keeper of the flame
But nobody know his pain
I'm the keeper of the flame
And everybody know his name

When I was hungry, you gave me no food
Though I was thirsty, you gave me no water
Should feel free from all misery

How long shall you carry that burdain on your shoulders
How long shall those tears keep running down your beautiful face?
We all have troubles now and again, know what I'm saying
No matter how hard you try trouble will find us one way or another
People had troubles since the pope was an altharboy
People had worries from when the dead sea was only critical
Hear those drums rolling and listen to those guitar skanking
[Chorus:]
Put a smile on your face don't let the troubles get you down... shoop shoop doooo
Put a smile on your face don't let the troubles get you down...
Let me tell you how we feel... we feel irie... irie we feel irie... irie... we feel irie... irie

Come on walk tall and keep your head high. I tell you again and again...

Cannot be kicked and don't fight
Cannot drink water and get drunk
Cannot drink whiskey and stay sober

And standing in the way of civil life, I would say
Take a vow of separation
And all the days of your life
Let no rays come down upon your self

The lips of the righteous teaches many
But fools die for want of wisdom
The rich man's wealth is in the city
Vexation of the soul is vanity
Destruction of the poor is their poverty
The poor man's wealth is in a holy place
Why do you fight each other?
Why do you kill your brother?
Then your reward will be the cemetery
We got to build a better nation
Clean up, clean up Jah creation
Or there will be no future for you, you and me

The lips of the righteous teaches many
But fools die for want of wisdom
The rich man's wealth is in the city
Vexation of the soul is vanity
Destruction of the poor is their poverty
The poor man's wealth is in a holy place
Why do you fight each other?
Why do you kill your brother?
Then your reward will be the cemetery
We got to build a better nation
Clean up, clean up Jah creation
Or there will be no future for you, you and me

We will trace the footprints one more time
We'll walk the circle once again
And we'll turn the pages one more time
We'll trace the footprints once again
There will be no compromise
There'll be no stones left unturned
And let love and honesty abide
We'll trace the footprints once again
When something's lost, then something is gained
If there was no sun, there would be no need for rain
Things will grow old, for the new to begin
There is no mystery, that cannot be explained
And the river flows to the sea
And the world keeps spinning around
Not even the Jordan River can keep us from the shore
We will trace the footprints one more time
We'll walk the circle once again
And we'll dig deep down in the sand
Till we find the rock on which we stand
We will trace the footprints one more time
We'll walk the circle once again
And we'll turn the pages one more time
We'll trace the footprints one more time
We will trace the footprints one more time
We'll walk the circle once again
And we'll turn the pages one more time
We'll trace the footprints one more time

This is real, this is real
[Verse 1]
Now I see them giving the woman abortion to kill another baby
Miscarriage and misfortune and premature crack baby
Strength of Rastafari I'm hoping someday maybe
They don't obey their parents, maybe they will obey me
Future for the babies
Hopes for the babies
Tomorrow for the babies
No sorrow for the babies
Babies having babies
Raising our babies
All of these young ladies
Give them thanks and praises
How long can she take it?
Dreams are full of 'maybes'
Will she ever make it?
Hustles on a daily
In the club she shake it, strip down 'till she naked
Don't ever mistake it, much too real to fake it
Need it then she'll take it
She'll do it for the babies
A mother's love is sacred
Now don't you ever fail me
[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
A woman needs caring, sharing, love all the time (no don't you ever fail me)
A child needs loving, caring...
[Verse 2]
Is there no other option than adoption for you babies
You're raffling and jacketing and auctioning your babies
Strength of Rastafari I'm hoping someday maybe
They don't obey their parents, maybe they will obey me
Cowards play the game thing
Fathers do the brave thing
And that's participating
He keeps on concentrating
There is no debating
No running away thing
A new life is awakening, from his ejaculating
It's in the oven baking
Takes two for the making
He's right there through the cravings
And early morning waking
School and educating
Sports and recreating, karate and ballet thing
Teenager of today thing
Fathers still relating, still communicating
And they'll always embrace him
Cause they cannot replace him
[Chorus Repeats]
[Verse 3]
And always do your very best to keep a promise to your babies
And if you can't be good, at least be honest to your babies
The strength of Rastafari I'm hoping someday maybe
They don't obey their parents maybe they will o...
History of the babies
Beginning of the ages
You're flipping thru the pages
And up and thru the 80's
Some are gang related, drug affiliated
Some intoxicated, headed for the snake pit
And Papa's locked in cages
And Mama's lacking wages
And this what they're faced with, upon a daily basis
Bleaching out dem faces
Running from dem races
Shooting up them places
Killing other babies
As bitter as the taste is, and words can not explain it
Just walk the narrow pavement
And speak of love not hatred

Wo-o-o-o! Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya! Woy-oh!
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah! Oh!
(We'll be forever loving Jah;
We'll be forever loving Jah!)
Some they say see them walking up the street;
They say we're going wrong to all the people we meet;
But-a we won't worry, we won't shed no tears:
We found a way to cast away the fears,
Forever, yeah!
(We'll be forever loving Jah) We'll be forever!
(We'll be forever loving Jah) Forever, yes, and forever!
(We'll be forever loving Jah) There'll be no end.
So, old man river, don't cry for me;
A-have got a running stream of love you see.
So, no matter what stages - oh stages -
Stages - stages they put us through,
We'll never be blue
No matter what rages, oh rages,
Changes - rages they put us through,
We'll never be blue:
We'll be forever, yeah!
(We'll be forever loving Jah) We'll be forever!
(We'll be forever loving Jah) Forever, and ever, yes, and forever!
(We'll be forever loving Jah) 'Cause there is no end.
'Cause only a fool lean upon -
Lean upon his own misunderstanding, oh ho, oh, yeah!
And then what has been hidden
From the wise and the prudent
Been revealed to the babe and the suckling
In everyt'ing, in every way, I say, yeah!
(We'll be forever loving Jah) We'll be forever!
(We'll be forever loving Jah)
'Cause just like a tree planted - planted by the rivers of water
That bringeth forth fruits - bringeth forth fruits in due season;
Everything in life got its purpose,
Find its reason in every season,
Forever, yeah!
(We'll be forever loving Jah) We'll be forever!
(We'll be forever loving Jah) On and on and on!
(We'll be forever loving Jah) We'll be forever, yes, yes -
we'll be forever.
(We'll be forever loving Jah)

Free like we want to be
Some time you want to get off
But the boss man say you gonna lose you pay
No chain on your feet now
9 to 5 got you beat now
You working hard to save
Inflation like a tidal wave
Are we free like we want to be
Tell me are we free like we want to be
Are we free like we want to be
Tell me are we free like we want to be
Racist get defeat
Black man vote and take you seat
Now them think we gonna quiet
Maybe we start a riot
What happen to the diamond they stole
The innocent blood run cold
Do we still have to live in poverty
Now they say we're free to be poor
But are we free like we want to be
Black man are we free like we want to be
Tell me are we free like want to be
Are you free are you free
Kept in emotion
Will cause an explosion
Let your love go
Let me know
Some people expect
That's not what them get
Become no slave
Of them evil and wicked ways
Are we free like we want to be
Are we free like we want to be
Are you free like you want to be
Are we free like we want to be
Can't walk the streets late at night
Without fear of parasite
Everyone has a inborn right
A inborn right to live
Who gave us the reason to fight
By promoting negative vibes
Who taught us of drugs and crime
Now they say we're free to homicide
Committing genocide
We freely homicide committing genocide
Man we free like we want to be
Black man we free like we want to be
Tell me we free like we want to be
Are you free like you want to be
We want to be free
Free like we want to be

We're all branches of the same family tree
But every family's different, don't you know?
Reaching for the sun comes very naturally
We've only got to let each other grow
I've got a home
I've found my place
I live with people
Who are glad to see my face
We're free to be
You and me
And you and me
We're free to be... a family
We're all working in the same big marching band
But drums and horns have different things to say
All together we'll ring music through the land
We've only got to let each other play
I've got a place
I've found my home
I'm only solo
When I want to be alone
We're free to be
You and me
And you and me
We're free to be... a family
So many groups in the family soup
So many combinations
Might be people who look like you
Or they might be no relation
Birds of a feather, they flock together
Yes, sometimes they do
But if a little bird joins an elephant herd
Hey, that's a family, too
We're all cooking up the same big barbeque
But we like spicy, you like sticky sweet
Maybe we can trade our recipe with you
Then how about we help each other eat
This is my home
These are my folks
These are our secrets
And our habits and our jokes
We're free to be
You and me
And you and me
We're free to be... a family
We're free to be
You and me
And you and me
We're free to be... a family

Happiness, reveal yourself to me
There's no chains around me, still I'm not free
Happiness, please reveal yourself to me, yeah
Only Lord knows, how I'm thirsty to be free

'Cause in Thee, blessed Father, do I put my trust

Oh, happiness, please reveal yourself to me, yeah

Yet some people treat me, as if I'm not fully grown
So never let me stay any longer, among the unjust, no
'Cause in Thee, oh blessed Father, do I put my trust
I said happiness, please reveal yourself to me, yeah
There is no chains around me, still I'm not free - oh yeah
Happiness, please reveal yourself to me

Reveal yourself to me

Marching down freedom's road
Ain't nobody gonna stop me, nobody gonna keep me

Those are the very people I want to fight
That's why I'm marching, yes, I'm marching
Marching down freedom's road
Ain't nobody gonna stop me, nobody gonna keep me

United we stand, divided we fall

I wanna thank you for the things you've done
I wanna thank you for your generosity
and I'll never be alone, that's because, that's because you are my friend
that's because, that's because you are my friend
Been through thick and thin together
through the ups and downs, yet we still remain
and I can talk to you forever
[Chorus]
Before I met you, I was real low, now everyone know
now that I know you hey I'm real high
I wanna thank you for the day and nights
I wanna thank you for the breath of life
without you I'd be lost
[Chorus]
Just as long, just as long as you're my friend
just as long, just as long as you're my friend
that's because you are my friend, you are my friend

Mmmmm
Ohhhhh
I gave her back the key to her front door
Cause it seems she didn't care about me anymore
I gave her all the love I had and she spilled it, yeah
So I packed my things into a shopping bag, and decided to quit
But Lord know that
I don't wanna be lonely tonight
I don't wanna be lonely tonight
I said, I don't wanna be lonely tonight
But I would rather to be lonely than to live a dirty lie
All of those things that we've been through
Used to make me happy, now make me blue
I didn't believe the things that I've heard, no
But now I've seen it with my own eyes
I know actions speak louder than words
But Lord know that, I don't wanna be lonely tonight
Granny know that, I don't wanna be lonely tonight
I mean it, yes I mean it, I don't wanna be lonely tonight
But I would rather to be lonely than to live a dirty lie
I'm so sorry, we've been true...
I'm so fed up I don't know what to do....
All of those things that we've been through
Used to make me happy, now make me blue
I didn't believe the things that I've heard, no

I know actions speak louder than words
But Lord knows that, I don't wanna be lonely tonight
Granny know that, I don't wanna be lonely tonight
I mean it, yes I mean it, I don't wanna be lonely tonight
But I would rather to be lonely than to live a dirty lie
Ahhhhh
I'm so sorry, we've been true...
Mmmmmm
I'm so fed up I don't know what to do....
Don't wanna be lonely...
Don't wanna be lonely tonight, I don't wanna be lonely tonight...

I've been sitting here for many days now
They've been looking for me for many days too
From where I'm sitting
I can see their angry faces
It's only a matter of time
They'll be on to me
The sirens, helicopters and tanks
The bloodhounds are on my trail, Oh God
Just in minutes
They'll be tearing me apart
If I don't do now
What I've been doing all my life
I'll be running... all my life
I was running... all my life
[Chorus:]
I'm the running man
The fugitive ...
Seeking political asylum is not easy thing down here
My father had friends in high places
And in low places too
Every time we asked him to stop running
He would say
"Leave all to me, I'll make it right"
Today he's gone, I'm still running
Coyotes and vultures closing in on me
I take it as a warning
I'll be running
I'll be running
'Cause I am
[Chorus till fade]

Why so many wrongs have been going on
It's my desire, to what I inquire
Why so many wrongs have been going on
It is because of lack of understanding
Or bad management of it's fulfillment
After prophecy, I think this world
Would be a better place, if you lived more seriously
Oh yeah, eh, yeah
The fussing and fighting
Each and every day
Can not help, in this time my brother
Fighting for war, is not your business

Each and every day
Oh waaaait
It's my desire, to what I inquire
Why so many wrongs have been going on, oh yeah
The fussing and fighting
Can't help, in this time we need more self respect
To everyone, it's my desire
It's my desire, to what I inquire
We need more self respect
To each and everyone
So many wrongs have been going on
It's my desire, to what I inquire
Great dream great dream, that if I was one?
So many wrongs been going on
I wanna know if it's lack of understanding
Or bad management, or is it fulfillment
After prophecy, we should live as one

Seven richest countries in the world
Them have a little meeting
Them a plan to keep and oppress the poor
So them have a little meeting
But when them think then thing goes another way
Yes when them think then thing goes another way
Did you hear about these meetings
No you won't find poor countries there
Because of capitalist greed
Revolution seem to be the only way
It may be an old fashion way of thinking
But I believe in the people and these aims
'Cause when them think then things go the people way
One day dem deh deh dem no deh deh
When them think then things go the the people way
One day dem deh deh dem no deh deh
These countries want to stay on top

'Cause when them think then thing goes another way
One day dem deh deh dem no deh deh
When them think then things go the the people way
One day dem deh deh dem no deh deh

In the garden of righteousness
Where to weep is to learn
There the wicked is no contest
We conquer them all
Jah don't spare the rod so the man can't spoil...
In the garden of wickedness
You reap what you sow
There the youth should dare not go
Remember what you've been told
Jah don't spare the rod so the man can't spoil...
In the garden of fruitfulness
You plan and it will grow
There death is of no threat
Life ever flows
Jah don't spare the rod so the man can't spoil...
In the garden of happiness
Where life is at its best
Despair is far from near
I am free from all material care
Jah don't spare the rod so the man can't spoil...
In the garden of righteousness
Where to weep is to learn
There the wicked is no contest
We've conquered them all
Jah don't spare the rod so the man can't spoil...
Never spare your rod from me...
Jah never spare that rod from me
I need it desperately

And there will be no more blaming someone else

I got to get out of town, leave the town
There's too much pollution is there a solution
Got to get out of town leave the town I wont be hanging around
I'm gonna catch the train I'll never play your game
My life isn't based on how much money I make
I wanna live in peace but it's hard today
There's always something trying to take it away
I rather change my situation than change who I am
Don't wanna hurt no one just to prove I'm a man
I wanna plant a little grass on a piece of land
And help this planet as best as I can
I've got to get out of town, leave the town
There's too much pollution is there a solution
Got to get out of town leave the town I wont be hanging around
I don't care bout the silver I don't care bout the gold
I don't care bout the sex with a heart that so cold
Misused by abuse and refused, refused by misuse and abuse
Hey where will I go nobody know
Maybe to Maui or maybe to Fiji or maybe to Ghana where my mama lives
Or way up to the Nine-mile hills
I got to get out of town, leave the town
There's too much pollution is there a solution
Got to get out of town leave the town I wont be hanging around
In this political rut oh who can you trust, Cause no ideology can ever control me
Who them you fool once, who them you fool twice
The silent majority everything's a conspiracy
Till you wake up one morning and the truth has dawned
Too late for most people they got stuck in the storm
Like a cub leaves the den a boy leaves his home
In search of a truth that must be found

I'mma ready
I never met a girl who makes me feel
The way that you do, but it's alright
The loving you're gonna miss every time
Let me remind you, you're out of sight

Get on board the train
For the evening train will be too late
But I don't hear it
Where is the evening train?
Sitting in the brightened sun
Waiting for the day to come
Wishing for the night to come
That won't help
Sitting in the brightened sun
That won't help
Each the night and day will come
That won't help
Get up now
Get up, stand up now
Sitting inside a soul
Crying every day for more
Crying every day for more
That won't help
Crying every day for more
Fly a bird in the evening sun
Burning out of control
Burning out of control
That won't help

Preacherman, don't tell me,
Heaven is under the earth.
I know you don't know
What life is really worth.
It's not all that glitters is gold;
'Alf the story has never been told:
So now you see the light, eh!

Get up, stand up: stand up for your rights!
Get up, stand up: don't give up the fight!
Get up, stand up: stand up for your rights!
Get up, stand up: don't give up the fight!
Most people think,
Great God will come from the skies,
Take away everything
And make everybody feel high.
But if you know what life is worth,
You will look for yours on earth:
And now you see the light,
You stand up for your rights. Jah!
Get up, stand up! (Jah, Jah!)
Stand up for your rights! (Oh-hoo!)
Get up, stand up! (Get up, stand up!)

Stand up for your rights! (Lord, Lord!)
Get up, stand up! (Keep on struggling on!)
Don't give up the fight! (Yeah!)
We sick an' tired of-a your ism-skism game -
Dyin' 'n' goin' to heaven in-a Jesus' name, Lord.
We know when we understand:
Almighty God is a living man.
You can fool some people sometimes,
But you can't fool all the people all the time.
So now we see the light (What you gonna do?),
We gonna stand up for our rights! (Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
So you better:
Get up, stand up! (In the morning! Git it up!)
Stand up for your rights! (Stand up for our rights!)
Get up, stand up!
Don't give up the fight! (Don't give it up, don't give it up!)

Accepting presents from foreign government
Weh still ah fool dem and a school dem and a khaki dem in
Good God of Moses and Rodney the Killer
Poor people fed up and we can't sim simmer
Can hardly survive as a blasted singer
Much less a baller who is a rahtid winger
Have a right foot like a David Villa
Him mother still ah sell inna market
Jamrock is a precious stone still it's far from a diamond, take it from I man
Even though Jamaica nice
You gotta live to save your life
After the sunset comes the darkness of the night
Better open up your eyes
You've gotta read between the lines

And then you talk how Jamaica nice
You say you living in a paradise
Poverty whistle like a Christmas breeze, yeah
You better take my foolish advice
Even though Jamaica nice
You gotta live to save your life
After the sunset comes the darkness of the night
You better open up your eyes
And read between the lines
When you're living in the ghetto paradise
Survival
Only the fittest
Shall make it out of this jungle alive
Survival
Jah is my witness
The darkest hours of the night is just before daylight
Even though Jamaica nice
You gotta live to save your life
After the sunset comes the darkness of the night
You better open up your eyes
Gotta read between the lines
When you're living in the ghetto paradise
Living in the ghetto, ghetto paradise
Living in the ghetto, ghetto paradise
Living in the ghetto, ghetto paradise
Living in the ghetto, ghetto paradise

Hey, hey, hey!
Give the people what they want
Well, its been said before, the world is a stage
A different performance with every age.
Open the history book to any old page
Bring on the lions and open the cage.
Give the people what they want
You gotta give the people what they want
The more they get, the more they need
And every time they get harder and harder to please
The roman promoters really did things right.
They needed a show that would clearly excite.
The attendance was sparse so they put on a fight
Threw the christians to the lions, sold out every night
Give the people what they want
You gotta give the people what they want
The more they get, the more they need
And every time they get harder and harder to please
Give em lots of sex, perversion and rape
Give em lots of violence, and plenty to hate
Give the people what they want
Give the people what they want
When olswald shot kennedy, he was insane
But still we watch the re-runs again and again
We all sit glued while the killer takes aim
Hey mom, there goes a piece of the presidents brain!
Give the people what they want
You gotta give the people what they want
Blow out your brains, and do it right
Make sure its prime time and on a saturday night.
You gotta give the people what they want
You gotta give the people what they want
Give the people what they want
Give the people what they want
Give the people what they want

[Chorus:]
If you live in a glasshouse
Don't throw stones
And if you can't take blows brother
Don't throw blows
Harm no man
Let no man harm you
Do unto others
As they would do to you
And to every baldhead
Respect the Rastaman
Cause he's the only man left on creation
[Chorus]
Cos cos to see I
Looking so humble
Would you like to try something
But your world would a crumble
Caught behind I back
You lied to grumble
And before I face
You always a fumble
[Chorus]
You build your world on lies and illusions
But you never know that
This is the conclusion
No chance no hope for those
Who kept it a goin'
'Cause you never know that
The truth is showing
[Chorus]
I'm on this earth
To give Jah praise
And all I ask for
Is longer days
I come to do the things that are right
And if you don't like my do it we're gonna fight
[Chorus]

Go tell it on the mountain,
Over the hills and everywhere.

In the middle of the night I heard her pray so bitterly
And so softly yeah...
She prayed for her children
She prayed for their education,
Then she prayed for the man
That left her with her children.
We, praise heroes everyday
But there are those that we forget To praise
The women of this world.
They don't run from anything
They stand and fight for what's right
[Chorus:]
Oh oh oh...
God bless the women
Even when times are so hard
They are so cool, calm and collected.
They don't run from anything,
They stand and fight
For what is right
They do not run from responsibilities
They stand and fight for what Is right
[Chorus: till fade]

I was born and raised in the ghetto
Talk with me and you'll know
I wasn't satisfied with living on the side
I started looking around for a possibility
But listen to my story, of what became of me
I met a businessman
Who said he got some friends back East
Said, "Why don't you come along?
Well we could help you atleast"
"Make you into a big star
By playing your guitar"
But the joke was on me
They left me flat to see
Going back West
(Going back West)
Yes I know, I'll make out alright
Going back West
(Going back West)
Where my music's playing all night
Going back West
(Going back West)
Think I'll do alright
Struggling for recognition, identity and respect
I got a lot of promises, they told me not to fret
Said, "We will stand by you
If the going gets rough"
But when I started sinking
They didn't even bluff
Going back West
(Going back West)
Yes I know, I'll make out alright
Going back West
(Going back West)
Where my music's playing all night
Going back West
(Going back West)
I think, I'll do alright
'Bout a year has come and gone
And left me standing here
Thinking how it could have been
'Cause still I ain't nowhere
They surely took me for a ride
Trampled on my pride
But I'll hold my head up high
Got no more tears to cry
Going back West
(Going back West)
Yes I know, I'll make out alright
Going back West
(Going back West)
Where my music's playing all night
Going back West
(Going back West)
I think, I'll do alright
Going back West
(Going back West)
Yes I know I'll make out alright
Going back West
(Going back West)
Where my music's playing all night
Going back West
(Going back West)
Think, I'll do alright
Going back West
(Going back West)
Yes I know, I'll make out alright
Going back West
(Going back West)
Where my music's playing all night
Going back West
(Going back West)
I think, I'll do alright

Our existence today
Mean so much for tomorrow
I'll always be there for you
Share your joys on top of your sorrows
But I will no longer live this life in the flesh
To the lust of man but to the will of God
All things have come to an end
Now be mindful of prayer
I'm gone away
To the place where there is no night or day 
I'm gone away
To that place, to that place 
When we're gone
What we leave behind is of no consequence
Just the love that we take
Will be our only memories
Like a child at play
The tears will soon dry away
Like a bright sunny day
No need to have any more fears
You're gone away
To the place where there is no night or day 
You're gone away
To that place, to that place
Gone away
Lululu...
Our existence today
Mean so much for tomorrow
I'll always be there for you
To share your joys on top of your sorrows
But I no longer live the life in the flesh
To the lust of man but to the will of God
Everything had come to an end
Now I've been mindful of prayer
I'm gone away
To the place where there is no night of day 
I'm gone away
To that place
Gone away

Gone, gone, gone, gone with the wind, say something

I need you every minute, need you every minute
Need you every minute

Every morning, every night you make me cry
Just because you know I love you
You told me to always wait for you there
Want me to lose my mind?
Then I'll start my crying around
All I do is cry while you just sit and you lie
You told me you really loved me
You loved me, loved me, loved me, loved me true
Want me to lose my mind?
Then I'll start my mind around
Sick and tired of wasting my time
Called you on the phone and you was not at home
That's too bad
You got me way deep down in a soul
That can make you more
Gonna need somebody now
Need somebody true

When you were a little girl
I had dreams and I had plans for you
As a single father I knew
There was gonna be turbulance
Along the way
I did not know that so soon
I'd have to stand on the side
Watch you go through life
Without my guidance you see
I wanted to be there when you cry
I wanted to be there when you smile
I wanted to be there when you play
I wanted to be there all your life
I would say it's wrong
She'd say it's right
Words got spoken since
I live in a glass house
I didn't want no stones to be thrown
I didn't want no blows to be thrown
But I would hate to see my...
[Chorus:]
Good girl go bad
Good girl go bad
The games we played
The rhymes you taught me
Everything we did together
Those were the best days of my life
I will always remember
The little girl you were once
I wanted to be there when you cry
I wanted to be there when you smile
I wanted to be there when you play
I wanted to be there all your life
I would say it's right
She'd say it's wrong
I would say it's wrong
She'd say it's right
Words got spoken since
I live in a glass house
I didn't want no stones to be thrown
I didn't want no blows to be thrown
But I would hate to see my...

Good girl go bad
Good girl go bad

Irie days come on play
Let the angels fly let the devils die
Got to do what you can with the time at hand
Ali boom mah yeah Ali boom mah yeah
Don't worry your mind its just the test of time
In five years these be the good old days
No one knows what the future holds for everything has a season
Its not a time for war its a time for peace
Tomorrow knows tomorrow woes
I remember when grandpa use to say grandson these be the good old days
These be the good old days
Now comes the moon with its starry lights
And so begins the night life
The tribal dance puts me in a trance
As she pulls me in with her magic swing
I asked of her what do we celebrate
She said to me these be the good old days
These be the good old days
Leh leh leh leh leh leh leh leh
There is no future there is only now
Let's cherish these moments that we now know
These be the good old days

There will be a time in your life
When you'll need me the most
But I won't be there
There will be a time in your life
When you won't need me at all
I won't be there
But while I've got the chance
I'm gonna tell you what I know
About this world we're living in
It may seem so beautiful
From where you are
It may look so innocent
In your eyes
But let me tell you
It's not a bed of roses
[Chorus: x3]
Good things come to those
Who got out and made them happen
They don't come to those who wait
I can sit here and teach you
Every trick in the book
But at the end of the day
It is your life
[Chorus: x3]
Good things come to those
Who got out and made them happen
They don't come to those who wait
You don't have to worry
The future is in your hands
[Till fade]

Naughty, naughty
Who knows how that love had to linger on
Someone help
Got to be there
Got to be there
Got to be there
Just to answer to your name when the roll is called for your fate
If you go the bad way
You must prepare to get bad pay
The seed you sow, girl
This you shall surely reap, my brother and sister
Got to be there
Got to be there

You just fuss around and try to work all your tricks on me
I know you would do that
I know you would do that
I know you would do that
Oh baby, do that
That's the way you want it
That's the way you like it
That's the way you love it
That's the way you want it
That's the way you need it
That's the way you love it
Hey baby, do you, do you
Do you, do you do
Got to, got to feel it
(Incomprehensible)
Get me, get me feel it
If you see me walking down the street with another girl
You just bust around and try to work all your tricks on me
So I saw you walking down the lane with another boy
And I just turned my face away and I walked a little faster
I know you would do that
I know you would do that
I know you would do that
Oh baby, do that
That's the way you want it
That's the way you like it
That's the way you love it
That's the way you want it
That's the way you need it
That's the way you want it
Hey baby, do you, do you
Do you, do you do
Get me, get me feel it
[?]
Get me, get me, got to feel it
So don't come around, knock on my door
I don't love you, I don't need you no more
Don't keep knocking upon my door
I don't love you, I don't need you no more
Don't keep knocking upon my door

[Chorus:]
If I'm dreaming don't wake me up if it's a lie don't tell me the truth
'Cause what the truth will do, it's gonna hurt my heart
Being in the darkness for so long now
Mr. President, did I hear you well Last night on TV
You said:
The group areas act is going Apartheid is going [x2]
Ina me eye me sight the future so bright
I mean I my eyes
I see the future so bright
When the blackie manna coming together
With the whitey manna [x2]
Whitey manna coming together with the blackman
[Chorus]
Gazing at my crystal ball I see the future so bright
The fighting's gonna stop now
We'll forgive and forget I know Mr. President
You can't please everyone
But everybody liked it
When you said
Group areas act is going
Apartheid is going [x2]
[Chorus: till fade]

There's a lot of silly young girls wanna show off
And you're wishing one day they will grow
But it's alright, it's alright
They only hear of the things that you know of
And you're wishing one day you will soar
But it's alright, it's alright
So let's have a talk
Like grown-ups do
Let's do the things that grown folks do
Me and you
Grown folks slackness, big woman hotness
Watch it mek me knock this, experienced fatness
Love it how me lock this, Gong to the Zilla
I'm a monster like a Loch Ness
Look how long my locks is
All bills paid, all bets made
House well clean, all bugs sprayed
Vacation tripping, she ain't tripping
Island skipping, fine wine sipping
Gourmet cooking, no Facebooking
Nothing to see 'cause she ain't looking
Tag team masseuses, deep bounce music
Natural juices, so therapeutic
Lips on my earlobe, softer than a q-tip
Getting kinda stony, acting kinda stupid
Pretending we're in high school, kissing at the movies
So do you're grown and sexy, baby 'cause your awesome
See some likkle young girls, don' beg you no pardon
Teach 'em how to walk it, welcome dem to stardom
There's a lot of silly young girls wanna show off
And you're wishing one day they will grow
But it's alright, it's alright
They only hear of the things that you know of
And you're wishing one day you will soar
But it's alright, it's alright
So let's have a talk
Like grown-ups do
Let's do the things that grown folks do
Me and you
Early morning wake-up, bringing me the papers
Continental breakfast, smoked salmon and capers
The eggs are over easy, you're putting on your make-up
We do some exercises, strolling through the acres
A mansion out in Gables, cottage in the Naples
Fingles out in Bordeaux, horses in the stables
Baby, we're connected, like TV is the cable
Like paper is the staple, like syrup is the maple
If Madonna's like a virgin, age is just a number
So tired of searching, getting weh me come for
She feeling kinda naughty, I'm feeling kinda rumpish
She is my accomplice, we're getting things accomplished
Call you by your last name, tell you that you're gorgeous
When I get around you I'm nervous till I'm nauseous
Tell me what's the hold-up, baby 'cause I'm anxious
Both of us are grown-up, drop your drawers to ankles
There's a lot of silly young girls wanna show off
And you're wishing one day they will grow
But it's alright, it's alright
They only hear of the things that you know of
And you're wishing one day you will soar
But it's alright, it's alright
So let's have a talk
Like grown-ups do
Let's do the things that grown folks do
Me and you

Jah Jah guide me from my friends cause I know...
I know my enemies...
Everytime I know...
I know my enemies...
They will come and
Sit round your table
Wanting to kill you like
Cain kill Abel
Only trying to find an easy way
That they can try to eliminate you
Jah Jah guide me from my friends cause I know...
I know my enemies...
Everytime I know my enemies...
Anytime you see your friend there
The first thing you see
Is him teeth, yes
But if you could see the inner part
Then we gonna know the sucker have got a wicked heart
May Jah Jah guide me from my friends cause I know, everyday...
I know my enemies...
Said I know my enemies...
Oh Jah Jah guide me from my friends cause I know...
I know my enemies...
Long time I been watching them, I know...
I know my enemies...
Your enemies stay far from you
And they don't...
They don't want to see you
While your friends will come
with a smiling face
And it don't mean another shoe's lace...
So Jah Jah guide me from my friends cause I know my enemies...
Everyday I know...
Oh my enemies...
Jah Jah guide me from my friends...
I know, I know, I know them, I know them...

Guiltiness (talkin' 'bout guiltiness)
Pressed on their conscience. Oh yeah.
And they live their lives (they live their lives)
On false pretence everyday -
each and everyday. Yeah.
These are the big fish
Who always try to eat down the small fish,
just the small fish.
I tell you what: they would do anything
To materialize their every wish. Oh yeah-eah-eah-eah.
Say: Woe to the downpressors:
They'll eat the bread of sorrow!
Woe to the downpressors:
They'll eat the bread of sad tomorrow!
Woe to the downpressors:
They'll eat the bread of sorrow!
Oh, yeah-eah! Oh, yeah-eah-eah-eah!
Guiltiness
Pressed on their conscience. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
These are the big fish
Who always try to eat down the small fish,
just the small fish.
I tell you what: they would do anything
To materialize their every wish. Oh, yeah-eah-eah-eah-eah-eah.
But: Woe to the downpressors:
They'll eat the bread of sorrow!
Woe to the downpressors:
They'll eat the bread of sad tomorrow!
Woe to the downpressors:
They'll eat the bread of sad tomorrow!
Oh, yeah-eah! Oh yeah-e-e-e-e-e!
Guiltiness. Oh yeah. Ah!
They'll eat the bread of sorrow everyday.

I don't know why
I keep believing
That one day, they'll bring us together
When they've shown
In more ways than one
That all they care about is the dollar
You belong to the one political party
I belong to the one musical party
Our differences are worlds apart
Just like guns and roses
If we don't take control
Of the situation
We'll stay forever in this ya commotion
[Chorus: x3]
These guns and the roses
That we've got to live with
How can five years of power
Destroy a lifetime of
Togetherness
One time we were judged
By the colour of our skins
Now we are judged
By the colour of our flags
Let us unite
Against being divided
You belong to the one political party
I belong to the one musical party
Let us take control of the situation
Otherwise we'll be trapped in this
[Chorus: till fade]

When they kick out your front door
How you gonna come?
With your hands on your head
Or on the trigger of your gun
When the law break in
How you gonna go?
Shot down on the pavement
Or waiting in death row
You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh, Guns of Brixton
The money feels good
And your life you like it well
But surely your time will come
As in heaven, as in hell
You see, he feels like Ivan
Born under the Brixton sun
His game is called survivin'
At the end of the harder they come
You know it means no mercy
They caught him with a gun
No need for the Black Maria
Goodbye to the Brixton sun
You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh-the guns of Brixton
When they kick out your front door
How you gonna come?
With your hands on your head
Or on the trigger of your gun
You can crush us
You can bruise us
And even shoot us
But oh- the guns of Brixton
Shot down on the pavement
Waiting in death row
His game was survivin'
As in heaven as in hell
You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh, the guns of Brixton
Oh, the guns of Brixton
Oh, the guns of Brixton
Oh, the guns of Brixton
Oh, the guns of Brixton

Once I was bound
By the name of J-E-S-U-S
To V-I-C-T-O-R-Y
I am
My man, I call upon you
Because you look so very strong
To C-H-R-I-S-T
To Christ, we are bound to win
That's why I'm saying
Hallelujah

Hear the children cryin',
but I know they cry not in vain.
Now the times are changin';
love has come to bloom again.
Smelling the air when spring comes by raindrops
reminds us of youthful days.
But now it's not rain that water the cane crops,
but the sweat from man's brow;
the substance from our spine.
We gotta keep on living, living on borrowed time:
Hallelujah time!
Yes, you can hear the children singing: Hallelujah time!
As they go singing by and by: Hallelujah time!
Oh, "hallelujah" singing in the morning.
Hallelujah time! Let them sing; don't let them cry.
Over rocks and mountains
the sheep are scattered all around.
Over hills and valleys,
they are everywhere to be found.
But though we bear our burdens now,
All afflictions got to end somehow:
From swinging the hammer, pulling the plough.
Why won't you let us be, to live in harmony?
We like to be free like birds in a tree.
Hallelujah time! Yes, you can hear the children singing.
Hallelujah time! Yes, as they go singing by and by.
Hallelujah time! Oh "hallelujah" singing in the morning.
Let them sing; never let them cry.
Hallelujah time! "Hallelujah" singin' in the morning.

They just keep holdin' me
A-won't let go
Holdin' me
Won't let go
I need a hammer - a hammer - a hammer - a hammer
To hammer them down
I need a rammer - a rammer - a rammer - a rammer
To ram them down
They just keep teasin' me
And, you know, they play like they don't know
Provokin me
But this is all I know
I need a rammer - a rammer - a rammer - a rammer
To ram them down
I need a hammer - a hammer - a hammer - a hammer
To hammer them down
Oh, I need a rammer - a rammer - a rammer - a rammer
To ram-a them-a down
Oh, I need a hammer - a hammer - a hammer - a hammer
To hammer them down
Said, I need a rammer - a rammer - a rammer - a rammer
To ram-a them down
I need a hammer - a hammer - a hammer - a hammer
To hammer them down
Holdin' me (ooh...)
Won't let go (ooh...)
Holdin' me (ooh...)
Won't let go (ooh...)
I need a rammer - a rammer - a rammer - a rammer
To ram-a them down
I need a hammer - a hammer - a hammer - a hammer
To hammer them down
(I need a rammer)
I need a hammer - a hammer - a hammer - a hammer
To hammer them down
I need a rammer - a rammer - a rammer - a rammer
To ram them down

Looks like mankind has surely gone crazy
Making bombs that leave buildings but kill babies
Believe in the Book of Revelations
And just like in the days of old
Just like in the days of old
Things are going down the way they're told
Handwriting's on the wall
Signs are clear, they're telling us all
Handwriting's on the wall, yeah ah
Signs are clear, they're telling us all
Oh, well, false prophets are plenty
Preaching lies to the few and the many
Even the changes of the seasons
Bring disaster and destruction for a reason
And just like in the days of old
Just like in the days of old
Things are going down the way they're told
Handwriting's on the wall
Signs are clear, they're telling us all
Handwriting's on the wall

I'll thank God for what He has done
Dear Lord, you make my happiness come
Now you showed me right things from wrong
And that's why I'll keep on singing my sweet songs
Oh yeah, I know that my life couldn't be the same
With this kind of living here and this kind of strain
So Lord I'll be right by your side
Dear Lord, and by your laws only I'll abide
No, I don't wanna do wrong
And that's why I'll keep on singing my sweet songs
I'll sing praise to you, you know that it's true
Dear Lord, I know that my life couldn't be the same
With this kind of living here and this kind of strain
So Lord I'll be right by your side
Oh yeah, and by your laws only I'll abide
No, I don't wanna do wrong
And that's why I'll keep on singing my sweet songs
I'll sing praise to you, yes I will
You know that it's true, yeah

Now I've heard you finally find yourself a new love
And he is treating you like more
Better than I used to do, is it true?
And I heard that very lately you've been engaged
And you're married and your wedding
Happens the day, the next day
But I don't care what you say
And I don't care what you wanna do
Say wherever you may be
I dedicate this song to you, ooh ooh
It's a happy anniversary, always bring lonely memory
Though you sent an invitation
To everyone you know, but me, ooh wee
I says happy anniversary, always bring lonely memory
So I pay that no mind
'Cause that's the way Jah want it to be
Try to forget about the past
But in my mind it's meaningless
And so I, need not to worry
'Cause happy anniversary, always bring lonely memory
Happy anniversary, that's the way Jah planned it to be
Happy anniversary, lonely memory
Happy anniversary, I'm so glad it isn't me
Lonely memory, happy anniversary
Lonely memory

I've got a hard road to travel and a rough rough way to go
Said it's a hard road to travel and a rough rough way to go
But I can't turn back, my heart is fixed
My mind's made up, I'll never stop
My faith will see, see me through
Let me tell you
I'm all alone, this lonesome road I roam
I've got no love to call my very own
Oh the river gets deeper, the hills get steeper
And the pain gets deeper every day, yeah

Aah, oh oh
Aah, oh oh - one more thing

Where there is love and peace and joy for me
Oh, in my eyes I see troubles and dangers for me
But destiny where it leads me I must go, hey
I've got a hard road to travel and a rough rough way to go
Said it's a hard road to travel and a rough rough way to go
But I can't turn back, my heart is fixed

Aah, oh oh - somebody please, help me right now

Love and hate can never be friends
Oh no, oh no
Here I come with love and not hatred
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow I
All the days of I life
Envy no one, no wish to be with no evil man
For there'll come the day
When you'll be whipped by the father's hand
Live up roots children
Live up rasta children
My head is anointed and my cup runneth over
Surely goodness and mercy
Shall follow I, all the days of I life

Here we go
My big ego is gonna get me in trouble
Trying to play hero
My jeans can't tight like Michael Phelps speedo
We no play follow fashion, when we lead out
Now looky here, my big ideas
Gonna get me in trouble now amongst my peers
But have no fear, no bother cry tears
You're just miles ahead when I'm ahead light years
(Here.. here I come again)
Gong originally, run fi the grand finale
(Have no fear.. for it is only I)
I do it regularly, through every hill and valley
(I'm here to teach you only truth)
It's Mister Warm and Easy
Somebody please believe me
(For the things you do, Jah is watching you)
Man a wah do some likkle bomboclaated
Weh feel like them big 'cause dem album charted
Well all bad card will be disregarded
No punk cyaan finish weh what Bob Marley started
Gong to the Zilla, I'm the Don Die-Hearted
Anywhere me go, dem roll out red carpet
Some man a buy car and nah no house fi park it
Nah unify dem selfish like market
Dem sell out dem souls just to be rewarded
Bleach out dem skin, dem favour dead to rahtid
Soul too corrupt and dem blemish and faulted
Real Rastaman we cannot be outsmarted
Gong's not the one fi a bwoy take chance with
Ancient Nazarite weh make the Red Sea parted
Provide the harvest, in drought and shortage
With Jah by my side I've got all advantage
(Here.. here I come again)
Gong originally, run fi the grand finale
(Have no fear.. for it is only I)
I do it regularly, through every hill and valley
(I'm here to teach you only truth)
It's Mister Warm and Easy
Somebody please believe me
(For the things you do, Jah is watching you)
So buy your tickets to the show, get there early grab a seat
The real Gong is in the house, everything else counterfeit
If I have not been around, it's a part of my mystique
I've been busy so to speak, I've been winning on a streak
I've been feeling like a Wednesday, surrounded by the week
Be strong alone continue, fi di justice where we seek
So doh follow some DJ cah dem swimming up a creek
Dem inna deeper shit when time dem an dem maker meet
And if you buy the bullshit, then don't lose your receipt
Them bound fi self destruct, mi ago lowe dem, mek you see it
Dem sow weh dem a reap, dem think say Jah no seet
When the stage show full a demon and the club dem full a freak
And the dancehall full a pagans and dance like dem a Greek
Dem renk and dem a reek, dem pop down one a week
Dem always overdweet, but turn the other cheek
The earth is for the meek, huh
(Here.. here I come again)
Gong originally, run fi the grand finale
(Have no fear.. for it is only I)

Hundred thousand photo shoot and million radio drop
Mi deejay til' me hoarse a welcome people to the rock
You think a silver spoon or like it drop inna mi lap
Me sign a billion autograph, up to now the tour no stop
Trade privacy for privilege, it balance when it swap
Tony Rebel say a reggae put Jamaica 'pon the map
Who am I to disagree when I've been reaping up the crop
My first release was '93, when dem a feed pon Similac
First Grammy at 23, tell me which one a dem do that
Another tour at 27, add it up and do the maths
The weight weh dem a carry that no heavy like me locks
I'm a veteran, the youngest to be exact
Ghetto people love me bad, I'm guessing opposites attract
Uptown me born and grow, Stony Hill to mark the spot
Big Gong to the Zilla and the return of the mac

Do you see the smiles on their faces
After you have done what you do best
Do you see satisfaction on their faces
After you have blessed them it's your gift
You don't think it's much
But to them it means the world
They wake up in the morning and wish you were there
Don't have to lie to gain their trust
You have never won a Nobel prize
They have never seen you on the TV
Your little contribution makes their lives a little bit better every day
[Chorus:]
You're a hero, you're a hero
Big it up, big it up
For the fireman
Big it up, big it up
For the street cleaners
Big it up for the man ad the woman who take care of abandoned children
Big it up, big it up
For the grandmothers
Who are left to take care of the children
Big it up, big it up Wo!

[Verse 1: Stephen Marley]
I've been gone a while away from you when I hope you overstand
That I've got to do what I must do to be a better man
'Cause if I was just to act a fool, do nothing with myself
Then all my blessings would be cursed, my world would crumble in
It's a joy when I sit down and think of the good times that we had
And what we do to make it through when the good turns to the bad
Well I hope you'll find it in your heart to know these words are true
And please don't fuss because I must go do what I must do
[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
Hey baby don't you worry, even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
If you thought that I was lost,
I had to bear my cross
Now I'm free from all these chains
[Verse 2: Stephen Marley]
A time, a space, a different place, how perfect we might be
I would be the wind that blows, you'd be that willow tree
And I could never bear the thought of you not by my side
So I would be the warmth of day, you'd be the cool of night
And everyday I pray to Jah that one day you will see
And overstand the fact I must fulfill my destiny
I hope you find it in your heart and know these words are true
And please don't cry – you know that I must do what I must do
[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
Hey baby don't you worry, even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
If you thought that I was lost,
I had to bear my cross
Now I'm free from all these chains
[Bridge: Stephen Marley (Mos Def)]
Well then it's not easy,
Jah knows how I try, I try
So don't you get weary (Oh God)
Jah knows how I try, I try
[Verse 3: Mos Def]
And God knows, that life is one big road
With a lot of signs and turns and twist and curves
Even though the road is rocky
But maintain the ride and keep on rocking
From city to city, backyard to yard
And we be seeing the sights and standing under the lights
And the spot is hot it's cold and lonely at nights
And I'm feenin and I'm dreaming and I'm holding you tight
But hold on, every single road I rode on
Comes to an end and I'm back home again
So baby please don't cry
It's no valley low and it's no mountain high
And our love don't die with the passage of time
It just grow more, it just keep strong
And even though I'm gone I ain't moving too far
You're the light through the dark shining right through my heart
So my journey just start
[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
Hey baby don't you worry, even though the road is rocky
I'll be coming home to you again
If you thought that I was lost,
I had to bear my cross
Now I'm free from all these chains
[Outro: Stephen Marley]
And if you thought that I was lost,
I have to bear my cross
Now I'm free from all these chains

[Chorus: Stephen Marley & Rovleta Fraser]
Hey girl!
The way you make me feel
I know your love is real
You satisfy my every want and need
Hey boy!
You're always on my mind
We need to spend more time
Cause no one else can touch my heart inside
[Verse 1]
She look so good in her clothes
She get dressed and roll
So much man a fly down, Call the pest control
Confident princess, She address them bold
She nah manifest, Fi them sexual goal
She wish them the best, Rasta bless them soul
Her mouth nuh filthy, Like nuh cess tank pool
Smarter than most intellectual fools
Weh spend them time pon internet chat rooms
She said, "Junior you're a genius
You think with your mind and not your penis
Your gang of Jamaican Al Pacinos
Drinking Blue Mountain cappuccinos."
Will I say, "Baby you're the cleanest
The true definition of what my queen is
Nothing could've ever really come between us
Share the same room and Jah will feed us."
[Chorus Repeats]
[Verse 2]
Why mi love her fi all she's worth
Sitn' fi gwan she wi start it first
Wheel and pop off, Supn' outta she purse
Whole heap a fool have to start disperse
Police ah come you see how fast she splurt
Can't find no sign of she khaki skirt
Light up the place like we spark these herbs
Love watch the way that she gwan
When a big tune a play pon the dance-hall set
Selector rewind every chance them get
The rhythm design fi she dance and sweat
All when morning ashine she nuh start dance yet
Man clear the line when she walk and step
But she nah pay no mind to remarks them mek
Always on time take a chance and bet
She's a fine piece of mind with right mindset
She said, "Junior you're a genius
You think with you're mind and not you're peanuts
Your gang of Jamaican Al Pacinos
Drinking Blue Mountain cappuccinos."
I say, "Baby you're the cleanest
The true definition of what my queen is
Nothing could've ever really come between us
Share the same room and Jah will feed us."
[Chorus Repeats]
[Verse 3]
So boom!
Animal you never know from you born
Places you only see when travel channel tun on
Our means of trans-p is when the camel run on
Camouflage and fatigue is our style and fashion
"Fliminitti" weh she have and that is the attraction
What she want is what she get and that is satisfaction
Well she want it all night and not just fi a fraction
Well too much long talking now a time fi action
Well she love fi spend money but she rather spend time
And if mi gone fi ten minute, She call me ten time
If mi nuh pick up then she panic
Then she call mi friend line
Cause she want the veteran fi come and bend up her spine
A substantial amount of African fly squat
I have to sip a roots and bun a one night cap
And she love the veteran, him always hit the right spot
And the way she feel so good
I have to bounce right back
[Chorus Repeats]

Hey world, look around today, people
Do you see, do you see, do you see what you like
Do like what you see, hahaha, you better wake up

And the green grass is turning to plastic
Well, I'mma sayin'

Once happy animal sing a sad song
Air polluted it smug
Ocean's fill with oil and rain

Missile flying higher than high
Once fall mountains and so high
The bubbling roots have lost their bubbles

Well, well it seems you don't even care
You came around you must be square
So we singing
Hey world, you better wake up

Ain't nobody gonna do it for you
Hey world, you better, you better wake up

And your green grass turning to plastic

These city walls
Are like a prison
Why we gotta keep on living
With our backs against the wall
We are creatures of love
Victims of hate
We gotta keep on living
With our backs against the wall
No no no
Start living on a higher vibration
Now we take it to the heights of creation
Perfection of divinity
Is everyone's duty
Don't waste your time
Living for the vanities
We are creatures of faith
Victims of destiny
Which we create
Now we living on a higher vibration
'Cause we take it to the heights of creation
You know what I'm talking 'bout
Don't tell me no
Baby I could scream and shout
But I won't

On another sphere
Well, it's a human existence
On another wavelength
Listen to me now
Now we living on a higher vibration
Then we take it to the heights of creation
Let me take you little higher
And then you take me little higher

I don't wanna hear it
No more fussin' and a fightin', baby
Baby, hold me tight
Baby, hold me tight

I knew exactly
What you were going through
It's just that I didn't have the right
To discuss your problems I saw you struggling
For our education I saw you struggling to get us clothes to wear mama
This man you got married to is dead alive
Over the years I asked myself
Many questions Is he my real dad or
Was I adopted mama I know it's difficult for you mama
But hold on I am a little grown up now
Oh Ho
[Chorus:]
Hold on just a little bit longer now [x4]
You were a laughing stock in the community

Makin' news out of you mama
Now is the time to show them that he who laughs last laughs the best, that's the way it is [x2]
[Chorus:]
Hold on just a little bit longer now
I know it's not easy for you mama but your tears will turn to laughter now that I'm a grown up mama
[Chorus: till fade]

Peter Tosh 
He fought for the repressed 
In his music
In his words
He was brutalized
For what he thought was right
For what he thought was true
He was a true prophet
In his music
In his words
He was a rebel 
With a cause
A righteous rastaman
One who did not compromise
To save the world

It's a serious matter
God is standing over
'Cause lightning and thunder brimstone and fire is gonna' to burn out the soul
Lightning and thunder brimstone and fire is gonna' to burn out the soul
Whoa whoa... The earth is hot like a melting pot

Lightning and thunder brimstone and fire it's gonna burn out the soul...

I thought it would be better
Now I'm a branded hot stepper
If I am guilty, Lord God
Then I will pay
Now I'm a victim
By the words men say
And now I'm wanted
There's a price on my head
So I, so I
Said I'm a wanted
But Jah won't let the wicked capture I, no way
If I get crucial
Along the way
Cause men has been brutal
By the games they play
And cause me to be wanted
There's a price on my head
So I, so I
Said I'm a wanted
But Jah won't let the wicked capture I, no way
I know things will be better
Though I'm a branded hot stepper
If I get wearied
Why step in the way?
I will get over
Cause it's a game men play
But now I'm wanted
For the things that I know not about, oh no
Said I'm a wanted
But Jah won't let the wicked get me on, no way
Wanted for doing good among my people
Night and day
Wanted for living clean among my brethren
The games the people play
Wanted for doing good
Things will be better
Though they brand me as a stepper

Freedom fighter standing on a mountain
In a foreign country
Trying to send a message
To his people, back in the ghetto
He had a home one time
Love of a girl
But he left all that behind
Oh yes I can hear him clearly as he whispers in the air
His voice came out loud and clear
All he asked for was a prayer and as he turns to walk away he said
[Chorus:]
I'm still here in the house of exile
For the love of the nation
Sun went down on the mountain
Birds flew back to their hiding places
Leaving him standing there like a telephone pole
In the still of the night
You and I dream
Dreaming of Romeo & Juliet
All he dreams about is the freedom of the nation
When every man will be equal In the eyes of the law
As he closes his eyes
For the last time he said again
[Chorus: till fade]

There's a day of feasting and a day of famine
Day of sadness and a day of joy
You could see in the day of feasting
Life isn't just a little play-like toy.
So the day arrived when you least expected
Cos you always thought you were well protected
Now you feel like a fish out of water
So now you're wondering what's the matter.
Oh remember you said it wouldn't happen to you
Now you're thinking how to start a new
A drowning man will catch at a straw
You were warned but you wouldn't take heed.
Everything in creation must obey a law.
Its true in words as it is in deed.
You were so puffed up in your pomps and pride
You're exposed you got none to hide
Yes, you used to look down on the folks beside you
Never they think you would have come down too
Remember they said you got to reap what you sow
Simple truth everybody know
Oh what are you on a house of exile
Watching you now on your own last mile
Yes, what are you on a house of exile
Watching you now on your own last mile
[Music interlude]
Oh what are you on a house of exile
Watching you now on your own last mile
O OH what are you on a house of exile
Watching you now on your own last mile
Everything in creation must obey a law.
Its true in words as it is in deed

Whoa... yeah...
How could I leave
How could I possibly go on
If you should say goodbye
Just like a rose
If you don't water it every morn
It widthers and it dies
Promise you won't leave me
Promise you won't hurt me
Promise you won't ever make me blue
If you ever leave me, If you should desert me
Baby I don't know just what I'd do
I don't know just what I'd do
I really don't know just I'd do
Whoa ho ho
It was ordained, that man should leave his mother and cling, to the woman that he loves (ummmm yeah)
I'm very sure, that I could never love anyone
The way I love you now
Oh oh yeah
Whoa ho ho ho
How could I, how could I baby
Whoa... yeah...
Whoa now now, oh oh yeah... oh yeah
...

Doo, do-do-wop, choo-wop, choo-wop...
How many times I've told you I love you?
But now you want to say that we are through
What more can I do?
What more can I say to you?
Now you're gone
Do you remember that first night we met?
That was a moment I never will forget
Love was at first sight
You came walking through the pale
Pale moonlight
Pale moonlight
Do you remember that first night we met?
That was a moment I'll-ah never will forget
Love was at your first sight
You came walking through the p-p-pale, p-p-pale
Pale moonlight
Pale moonlight
Doo, do-do-wop, choo-wop, choo-wop...

There's lady that I love so much
She's always on my mind, night and day
But people told me she's in love
With another guy in town
This news makes me so sad
I'm confused, I don't know what to do about it
How will I know if she loves me
I'm confused
How will I know if she loves me
Does she really care for me
How will I know if she loves me
I'm confused
I've tried to get her off my mind
But the love she gives to me, draws me every time
I've tried to get her off my mind
But the love she gives to me is so strong
Each time when we were together
She use to tell me that I'm the only guy
{I felt this myself to this woman}
Now I'm so confused
People told me she's in love
With another guy in town
This really makes me so sad
I'm confused

How will I know if she loves me
How will I know if she loves me

I can see so many hypocritism
Everyone are talking this and talking that
Watching how I cook my pot Jah Jah
They always say I'm doing the right thing
And behind me they try to su-su-su-sue unna me
I want to show them that I'm the rasta man
To make the people know my culture
So you see, I've got to stand up on my feet
I've got to carry out my work
Every man got a talent, I got my talent
I've got to show them what it's all about
I've got to say Rastafari
All I can see so many hypocritism
Man and man just fighting against their brother
And if I don't make sure that I'm around the right side
I have to beg Jah for forgiveness
If I cook dumpling Jam-Town gone tell me speak
They always think of me and I don't see them
But one thing more, I've got to control
Excuse me while I smoke my spliff

All I've got is good, good Sensi love
To give you baby, it's just that all I see..

Sometimes I feel like
The richest man in Babylon
And I've done my best
So everything's alright inside
Oh every morning, Oh every morning
I rise, I stare at the sun
I know it is a blessing
So when the evening comes I
Lift up my eyes to the hills I'm blessed, oh man
With my two hands in the air as far as I can
As far as I can

Oh every morning

Lift up my eyes to the hills I'm blessed oh man

Sometimes I'm lost and far from home
But I'll find my way
Follow my heart and know I'll be found, someday
While I'm lost I learn and live
What do you say?
Let's have a good time until that day
Oh every morning, oh every morning

Hey, you know just how to hurt me
And how to take all my fears away
Girl, you must be the devil in disguise
There were times I thought you knew
That I was so afraid of you
There's some kind of madness in your eyes
Well, you know a place buried deep in my heart
Nobody else could see
Something in you has taken some kind of hold on me
I don't know why I keep coming back to you, baby, oh, no

Don't wanna live on mars
I don't wanna drive space cars
I just wanna be with you
And do the things we do
Don't want to escape to the moon
Even if the world went boom
I just want to be with you
And do the right things to you
You give me everything I need
You're my garden, You're my breeze
Let me get down, and thank you please
Hey let me lay here for a while,
Cause you're beauty makes me high
If you cry then I will cry
Yeah, let me make one thing clear
Nothing can compare
You're love is the blue sky
You're love is a butterfly
I don't want to live on mars
I don't want to drive space cars
I just want to be with you
And do the things we do
Don't want to escape to the moon
Even if the world went boom
I just want to be with you
And do the right things to you
Oh good karma you're my queen,
Precious things my eyes have seen
Sweetest place I've ever been
You make me feel just like a king,
I'll never leave you for that girl
Oh my darling you're my world
That witch called winter is so mean,
Summers that I've never seen,
They say I'm love crazy, love crazy
Can't take the heat turn down the fire
Can't swim don't tempt the waters
Believe what you want, this is my point of view
I wanna be cool, so let me get through to you
I don't want to live on mars
I don't want to drive space cars
I just want to be with you
And do the things we do
Don't want to escape to the moon
Even if the world went boom
I just want to be with you
And do the right things to you
I don't want to live on mars
I don't want to drive space cars
I just want to be with you
And do the things we do
Don't want to escape to the moon
Even if the world went boom
I just want to be with you
And do the right things to you

You want me to play the game you tried again and again
To sell myself for fame fit in the format man
To suit the image you want portrayed so the people are still enslaved
You can't define what we do I won't be put in a box for you
I get out, I get out, I get, I get out, I get out
I of the universe won't be prisoners of your little world
The mind is limitless where time does not exist
We travel far beyond the realms of expectations
And I refuse to be what you expect of me
I get out, I get out, I get, I get out, I get out
What would you lose to gain the price is high to pay

I hope we get to love in time
'Cause I got to make you mine
Before I lose you; I couldn't stand the pain
The road to love has tragedies
Some loves don't get to be
Laying the tears in someone's eyes, I won't cry
And it could happen to us if we're not strong
So why don't we hurry to love before it's gone
I hope we get to love in time
'Cause I got to make you mine
Before I lose you, I couldn't stand the pain
I hope you'll fall in love with me
'Cause it would be a tragedy
If I should lose you, I couldn't stand the pain
The gates are open, we're so close
Love is almost ours to hold
A few more steps and we'll be there, if you care
We'll make it together, it's easier that way
With two falling deeper love will soon be ours to stay
I hope we get to love in time
'Cause I got to make you mine
If I should lose you, I couldn't stand the pain
I hope you'll fall in love with me
'Cause it would be a tragedy
If I should lose you, I couldn't stand the pain
I hope we get to love in time
'Cause I got to make you mine
If I should lose you

In the beginning
According to the old book say
There was nothing
Then the great spirit came down
And said it, let there be
And there was
That's how it all began, yeah
Yet still we ask
Where did the universe come from?
Everything in existence
From the sky to the depths of the ocean
Every shape, every colour, every pigment
Every sound and every vibration
This old earth, the solar system
Everything you hold so sacred
By the hands of lord we were [?] created
And I know love
Lifted me
And I know Jah Jah, yeah
Set me free
Love break the chains, yes
Set the captives free
Love break the chains
Set the captives free
Wa da da da da da da da
So if there was nothing
Whose voice it was that said let there be light?
Who seperated the day from the night?
Created me, created you?
I believe it was love, oh yes
Still we want to know
Where did the universe come from?
Everything in existence
All yuh temples, yuh mosque and yuh churches
All the saints and the gods that we worship
The holiest of writings
The thunder and the lightning
Everything you hold so sacred
By the hands it flowed, it was created
So I know love, yeah, yeah, yeah
Lifted me
And I know Jah Jah, yeah yeah
Set me free
Love breaks the chains
Love breaks the chains
Set the captives free, yes
Love breaks the chains
Set the captives free
Call it what you may
L-O-V-E can be found in you (can be found in you)
And its all over me
Jah is love no matter the name
It's one and the same
Dance

I know we can make it if you don't break up our true love
Things will be better if we stick together all of our life
There is a fountain flowing with milk and honey for you
Life will be better, we can make it together, oh yes, we can
I'm singing, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm singing, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
They say you're getting out of your head
You should try and hold up instead, ooh
You say you're getting out of your head
Why you keep on worrying yourself?
Keep worrying yourself, so much
If your love is mine then let me know
You say you're getting out of your head
You should try and hold up instead
You say you're getting out of your head
Why you keep on worrying yourself?
Keep worrying yourself, so much
If your love is mine then let me know
I know we can make it if you don't break up our true love
Things will be better if we stick together all of our life
There is a fountain flowing with milk and honey for you
Life will be better, we can make it together, oh yes, we can
I'm singing, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Wo, man, deh you are!
When the race gets hard to run,
It means you just can't take the pace.
When it's time to have your fun,
You find the tears run on down through your face,
Then you stop and think a little:
Are you the victim of the system?
Anyday now they gon' let you down;
Remember, Natty will be there
To see you through.
(I) And ain't it good to know (know) now:
Jah will be waiting there.
(I) Ain't it doggone good to know (know) , you all;
Jah will be waiting there.
Wait in Summer, wait in Spring,
Wait in Autumn, Winter thing,
(Tribe) goes up, all the tribe goes down:
Bring my children from the end of d'earth
Many a time I sit and wonder why
This race so - so very hard to run,
Then I say to my soul: take courage,
Battle to be won,
Like a ship that's tossed and driven,
Battered by the angry sea, yea-eah!
Say the tide of time was raging;
Don't let the fury fall on me, no, no!
(I) 'Cause I know (know) -know:
Jah will be waiting there;
(I) Ain't it good to know (know) now:
Jah will be waiting there. Wo-oo-o-oo-o! Ooh, yeah!
Lost and found, who speak I give;

These words I say to you I hope
Will touch the strings within your heart
Wherever there's a song to play
These words to bring you pleasant dreams
Throughout the night of lonely sleep
I'll keep you warm while I'm away
I see you every hour of the day
I see you all through the night
I see you in the dark
I see you in the light
Your love is really on my mind
Words that remain while you awake
A dawn to greet another day
A day of love that we'll both share
Our hearts to dance like swaying leaves
Of roses in the gentle breeze
These words and dance so pure and clear
Listen

(I shot the sheriff
But I didn't shoot no deputy, oh no! Oh!
I shot the sheriff
But I didn't shoot no deputy, ooh, ooh, oo-ooh.)
Yeah! All around in my home town,
They're tryin' to track me down;
They say they want to bring me in guilty
For the killing of a deputy,
For the life of a deputy.
But I say:
Oh, now, now. Oh!
(I shot the sheriff.) - the sheriff.
(But I swear it was in selfdefence.)
Oh, no! (Ooh, ooh, oo-oh) Yeah!
I say: I shot the sheriff - Oh, Lord! -
(And they say it is a capital offence.)
Yeah! (Ooh, ooh, oo-oh) Yeah!
Sheriff John Brown always hated me,
For what, I don't know:
Every time I plant a seed,
He said kill it before it grow -
He said kill them before they grow.
And so:
Read it in the news:
(I shot the sheriff.) Oh, Lord!
(But I swear it was in self-defence.)
Where was the deputy? (Oo-oo-oh)
I say: I shot the sheriff,
But I swear it was in selfdefence. (Oo-oh) Yeah!
Freedom came my way one day
And I started out of town, yeah!
All of a sudden I saw sheriff John Brown
Aiming to shoot me down,
So I shot - I shot - I shot him down and I say:
If I am guilty I will pay.
(I shot the sheriff,)
But I say (But I didn't shoot no deputy),
I didn't shoot no deputy (oh, no-oh), oh no!
(I shot the sheriff.) I did!
But I didn't shoot no deputy. Oh! (Oo-oo-ooh)
Reflexes had got the better of me
And what is to be must be:
Every day the bucket a-go a well,
One day the bottom a-go drop out,
One day the bottom a-go drop out.
I say:
I - I - I - I shot the sheriff.
Lord, I didn't shot the deputy. Yeah!
I - I (shot the sheriff) -
But I didn't shoot no deputy, yeah! No, yeah!

We sat by the fire every night
We had our meals from the wooden pan
We were sitting on the wooden chair
She came near and whispered in my ear
She said she wants me always by her side
And I said...
[Chorus:]
I wanna take you to Jamaica, African lady
I wanna marry you, you're gonna be, the regggae man's wife
I wanna take you to Jamaica, African lady
I'm gonna marry you, you're gonna be, the reggaeman's wife
I wanna take you to Jamaica, african lady
I wanna marry you, you're be, just a reggae man's wife
I just don't care what the people say
Grab my hands and you're all I'm living for
She came near and whispered in my ear
She said she needs me always by her side
And I said...
[Chorus]

Say, say, say
Do, do, do
Say, say, say
Do, do, do
Wanting, needing
Saying, praying
Dreaming, hoping
Waiting, playing
Won't get you what you want
If you keep saying you can't
Won't get you what you need
Really in words and deeds
You've got to do it
And when you do it
You will get through it
And you get through it, you say
I want, I do, I get
I want, I do, I get
I want, I do, I get
I want, I do, I get
And it is done
Thinking, planning
Wishing, longing
Crying, lying
Hesitating, procrastinating
Won't bring you sweet success
Won't bring you happiness
Won't bring you sweet caress
Won't bring you reprogress
You've got to do it
And when you do it
You will get through it
And you get through it, you say
I want, I do, I get
I want, I do, I get
I want, I do, I get
I want, I do, I get
And it is done
Not enough to say, say, say
You got to do, do, do
It's not enough to say, say, say
Here's what you do, do, do
Not enough to say, say, say
It's all you do, do, do
Not enough to say, say, say
You've got to do, do, do
I want, I do, I get
I want, I do, I get
I want, I do, I get

I've got to take a little time
A little time to think things over
I'd better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older
This big mountain I must climb
Ohh feels like the world upon my shoulders
Through the crowds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder
In my life, there's been heartache and pain
I don't know, if I can face it again
I can't stop now
I've travelled so far
To change this lonely life
[Chorus:]
I want to know what love is
Reggae can show me
I want to feel what love is
Reggae can show me
I'm going to take a little time
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like reggae has finally found me
In my life, there's been heartache and pain
I don't know, if I can face it again
Can't stop now
I've travelled so far
To change this lonely life
[Chorus:]
I want to know what love is
Reggae can show me
I want to feel what love is
Reggae can show me
[Till fade]

And I want you to know how I feel too
That I'm sorry, baby, I said, I'm sorry
I'm sorry, terribly sorry
I'm sorry and I want you to know
No, man!

You may think that I don't care
'Cause I've been a rover here and everywhere
In Princeton, you bet, about me they never yet say good
But one thing I like about you
You always do as you should and that's why
If I don't, if I don't have you
Then for me, there'll be nobody else, no, oh no
And even if the river should run dry
For me, there'll be nobody else, no, oh, no
I may stay away for a night or two
But all form of respect unto you is still due
Though staying away make you feel mad, it make you feel blue
But it's not that I really mean to embarrass you, 'cause darling
If I don't, if I don't have you
Then for me there'll be nobody else no, oh no, no
And even if the trees should touch the sky
For me, there'll be nobody else, believe me
I may stay away for a night or two
But all form of respect unto you is still due
Though staying away make you feel sad, it make you feel blue
But it's not that I really mean to embarrass you, 'cause darling
If I don't, if I don't have you
Then for me there'll be nobody else, no, oh no, no
And even if the river should run dry
For me there'll be nobody else, oh no
If I don't, if I don't, if I don't have you
For me there'll be nobody else, believe me
If I don't, if I don't, if I don't have you
Nobody else will do

[Verse 1]
Want to commit suicide
Cause you've been denied your 9 to 5
You're in 2 deep
If you're over 10
And watch CNN and believe everything
You're in 2 deep
And your 35
And you still survive, idle pon corner side
You're in 2 deep
And your 55
And don't have a child, for your joy & your pride
You're in 2 deep
And yuh riding a freak
And she love how you do it, and your condom deplete
You're in 2 deep
And she seh, "Baby please."
And you're weak in the knees and kick off and release
You're in 2 deep
Then you hear from the streets
Seh she full of disease, and you start to sneeze
You're in 2 deep
All months and fi weeks
All food yuh nuh eat, and you weight start decrease
Youre in 2 deep
[Chorus]
So don't be in 2 deep
For you wi' incomplete
When you drop in the streets
You wi' drop in 2 deep
And don't be in 2 deep
For you wi' incomplete
When you drop in the streets 
You wi' drop in 2 deep
[Verse 2]
You a war 'gainst the Beast
And when things fi squeeze, that's when you-a freeze
You're in 2 deep
And you one a bleach
And you drop asleep, and machine a beat
You're in 2 deep
You exault and hype
Like you fling Dandimite, and nuh live gangster life
You're in 2 deep
And a run off you beak
And your thing go breach, and Bad Man go see it
You're in 2 deep
Then if a one police
Find you with yuh piece, and you start to squeal
You're in 2 deep
And you get release
Man a circle you neat, and you think it nuh real
You're in 2 deep
Then true things go steep
You fi sneak some coke in your crease
It's in 2 deep
And go overseas
And same time you reach, dog sniff out you crease
He's in 2 deep
[Chorus Repeats]
[Verse 3]
You a brag 'bout your wealth
And speak of yourself, like you're someone else
You're in 2 deep
When you just start to grow
But you think you a pro cause you see it inna show
You're in 2 deep
Thin  you know everything
And worship the bling and deny King
You're in 2 deep
Mesmerized by the beat 
CD on repeat memorizing my speech 
You're in 2 deep

In my song he is the rhythm and tempo
And when you're feeling out
Don't sit down and cry

In the name of god you kill in the name of your god
In the name of god you conquered in the name of your god
All religion should be wiped out
So that people may just live
What divides us is an illusion
Made up by men in their confusion
In the name of god you kill in the name of your god
In the name of god you conquered in the name of your god
In the name of god you hate in the name of your god
In the name of god you boast in the name of your god
Spoke of love no one would listen
Seems everyoneOs trying to prove something
Starting over may be the best thing
So stop the bombs and letOs begin
Cause this war no one can win and it seems IOll never learn
Oh this war no one can win well it seems IOll never learn
In the name of god you kill in the name of your god
In the name of god in the name of your god you conquered
In the name of god in the name of your god
All religion should be wiped out
Save the people stand and live
What divides us is an illusion
Made up by men in their confusion
In the name of god you kill in the name of your god
In the name of god you conquered in the name of your god
In the name of god you boast in the name of your god
In the name of god you hate in the name of your god
In the name of your god, why do you kill?, why do you hate?, in the name of god, in the name of god

[Verse 1:]
Are we independent?
It depends,
On what yuh call independence
Cah di jamaican dollar it doh mek nuh sense an wi still dependent.
Nothing's different 
Cah nobody naah think different,
Dem rather live inna illusion, because di truth hard fi swallow like yuh drink cement.
Mi haffi wonder if a plan ting!!! Or coincidence,
Who have di power of influence?
I.M.F. call shots, push button, world bank pull strings like instruments.
HENCE, things so tense,
Bruk is to pocket like zinc to fence
Mi haffi wonder if wi woulda better off a spend pound and shilling an pence.
[Chorus:]
I pledge my heart forever to serve with humble pride, 
this shining homeland ever, so long as earth abide
[Verse 2:]
Are we independent? Or in pretence,
Gunshots replace pens and pencils,
Most yute naav nuh trade and the few that do can't afford utensils,
Nor the fundamentals, nor the bare essentials
So dem tek di wrong road an flair off course and crash juss like a rental.
Mi all a wonder if a purpose!!! Or accident,
Dem tax everything dung to oxygen,
Leaders tear di nation down di nation it mash up like di taxi dem
WELL!!!!
Fix the dents, or face the consequence,
Protest, social unrest been going on for centuries 
[Chorus:]
[Verse 3:]
Are we independent? Or indifferent?
Do we even care what independene is?
Because wi sell out wi coastline, landline, airline, phoneline, online, bloodline, lifeline, deadline, headline, frontline, timeline, electic lightline, trainline, starline, clothes-line, punchline, lunchline
And naural resources gone to foreign sources
Business so exclusive, 
isolate di tourists, inna di all inclusive
Don't give us no excuses, we can withstand he bruises
Tell us wha the truth is!!! (Weh di truth?)
[Chorus:]
All who pledge to this nation [x2]
Sing it loud an raise yuh hand [x2]
Proud to be a jamaican [x2]
Stand up strong for where you're from [x2]

Into the groove, where we lose ourselves just to find who we are
into the groove, where we get to fly but we need not see the sky

"I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. 
That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. 
I should like to help everyone, if possible, Jew, Gentile, Black man, White. 
We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. 
We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. 
We don't want to hate and despise one another.
In this world there is room for everyone. 
And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. 
The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. 
Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.
We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in.
Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. 
Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. 
We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. 
More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. 
Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.
The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. 
The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, 
cries out for universal brotherhood, for the unity of us all. 
Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women and little children,
victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. 
To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair. 
The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress."

I pray thee
Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine of such vain things?
False kings of the earth hath set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together
Against the Lord God Jah Rastafari and against his anointed, saying
Now come let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us
He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh
The Lord God Jah Rastafari shall have them in derision
But then shall he speak unto them in his wrath
And vex with them in his sore displeasure
Cah I have set my king upon my holy hill of Zion
I will now declare the decree
The Lord God Jah Rastafari hath said unto I and I and I
That thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee
Now ask of I and I and I, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance
And the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession
Jah, shalt break them with a rod of iron
Jah, shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel, as I would say
So be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, judges of the earth
Serve the Lord God Jah Rastafari with fear, and rejoice with trembling
'Cause I and I the Son, lest he be angry
But purge from his ways, when his wrath is kindled but a little
And so blessed be all, blessed be everyone, as I would say
Blessed be everyone, as I would tell you

[Stephen:]

She got outside one morning
To see what's going on
'Cause she heard all the noises
In the night, It's a celebration
Even though she was old and grey
It didn't mean she was deaf and dumb
She took one look at the man
Throws her hands in the air
And said God help us all
Too much power in one mans hands
Is dangerous
She has never tasted freedom
And all the things
We take for granted
Then she looked at me and said
Son, Is this the end of our suffering?
[Chorus:]
Is this freedom?
Is this freedom?
We have just witnessed the
Change of power from one fool
And liar to another
Our lives on the line again
She had lived through the wars
She didn't wanna go through it all again
She has seen injustice
She has seen corruption
She has seen racism
And any other kind of suffering
You can think about
Then she said to me
Son, Is this the end of suffering?
[Chorus: till fade]

You want it to be
Is this the way
It's gonna be [x2]
Oh my God Oh my God
What we gonna do
In this world
In this world we live in [x2]
I see these men
Everyday at the corner
Of Queens and Commissioner
Begging for a dollar everyday
Begging for a dime everyday
Trying to make a living
Out there
But it's so hard [x2]
[Chorus: x2]
Begging for a dollar
Begging for a dime
One of them
Swallowed his pride
His broken pride
And came to me he said
I quit, I give up
Life is a game
What are the rules
What did I do to deserve this
Begging for a dollar everyday
Begging for a dime everyday
Trying to make a living
Out there
[Chorus]

When you feel like loving
I feel like loving too
When you feel like kissing
I feel like kissing too
When you feel like dancing
I feel like dancing with you
And this must be true
True love
Tell me that you love me
Cause I'm in love with you
Although it's the first time I met you
I feel like kissing with you
Just tell me that you love me
Cause I'm in love with you
And this must be true
True love
Tell me that you love me
Cause I'm in love with you
I've been kind you told me
You will love no one but me
Though it's the first time I met you
I feel like kissing with you
This must be true
True love
Tell me that you love me
Cause I'm in love with you
I've been kind you told me
You will love no one but me
Just when you feel like kissing
I feel like kissing with you
And this must be true
True love
This must be true
True love

It was written down there by those prophets
It was written down there on the ground
It was written down there by those prophets
It was written down there on the ground
One love, one heart
One eternity, one joy
Come sing a song with me and do your harmony
Go sing a song with me and do your harmony
My father sent me to warn the nation
It was written down there from creation
My father sent me to warn the nation
It was written down there from creation
One love, one heart
One eternity, one joy
Come sing a song with me and do your harmony
Go sing a song with me and do your harmony

And it was written up in the book of life
That man shall endure forever more
And it was written up in the book of life
That man shall endure forever more
Well, did you know the pen is stronger than the knife
They can kill you once but they can't kill you twice
Did you know destruction of the flesh is not the ending to life?
Fear not of the anti-Christ
Did you know that I exist before the earth?
And did you know that my eyes are windows to the world?
Did you know you can't go, ah Zion and wear Jerry curls?
Can't tell the boys from the girls
Your body is just a vehicle transporting your soul
It's what's inside of people is beauty to behold
Fear not of evil, every day them flesh it grow old
Changes of the times take a toll
And it was written up in the book of life
That man shall endure forever more
And it was written up in the book of life
That man shall endure forever more
Fear is in the eyes of the beholder
Love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer, live much longer
Fear is in the eyes of the beholder
Love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer, live much longer
A wester on his chest and Rastafari is his name
A gift of everlasting life for us to all sustain
Blessing that you all be got
Lessons taught you all forgot
Rasta call I shit you not
Do you remember Elijah and his chariot of flames
Same blood that run through my veins
Fear is in the eyes of the beholder
Love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much longer, live much longer
Fear is in the eyes of the beholder
Love is in the presence of the love maker
Life is in the words of the comforter
Endure much

I've been a stranger to myself
I've felt alone like no one else
I've seen the good suffer long
I've felt the power of love
I've made a way out, flew where to go?
And what's it all for? I don't know
But it must be said, just so you know
That it's alright, it's alright, it's alright 
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I said it's alright, it's alright, it's alright 
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
The sun rise and rise and rise 
and rise again
I've caught a glimpse of her, beautiful
I've come to learn pain teaches more than hurt
Some come to the end of the world 
Just to wake up be reborn
I've seen the weak overcome, the strong
And what's it all for? only Jah knows
But no matter how this life unfolds yeah
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright 
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I said it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

If I keep telling myself that's it'd be alright

I said it's alright, it's alright, it's alright

Lord have mercy
I remember the day I called mama on the telephone
I told her mama I'm getting married
I could hear her voice on the other side of the telephone she was smiling
And she asked me a question that I proudly answered
She said son did you take time to know her
I said mama she's the best
But today it hurts me so
To go back to mama and say mama I'm getting divorced
Oh I'm getting divorced
This choice I made didn't work out the way I thought it would
This choice I made
It hurts me so mama
This choice I made didn't work out the way I thought it would
This choice of mine Oh mama said to me
[Chorus x2:]
It's not easy to understand it son
But I hope you'll make it
You'll be happy again
I remember in church
When the preacherman read the scriptures
You look so beautiful so beautiful and so innocent
I did not know that behind that beauty
Lies the true colors that will destroy me in the near future
This choice I made didn't work out to be what I thought it would be
Oooh mama
This choice I made didn't work out the way I thought it would
Now I'm hurting
I remember when I held you
By the hand preacherman read the scriptures
Putting words in your mouth
Maybe what the preacherman said was not something that was within you
Now I know what they mean when they say
Beautiful woman is another man's plaything
Oh Lord I'm hurting now
This choice I made didn't work out the way I thought it would
This choice of mine Oh mama said to me
[Chorus]
It's not easy to understand it son
But I hope you'll make it

It's you, it's you, it's you, it's you
Yeah, yeah, it's you, it's you
And I got to say
(Yeah)
Aya, aya

I hear you gone looking for what you want hope you find what you need
I hear you gonna try and find it do you know what it is
I hear you gone looking for what you want hope you find what you need
Not all that glitter is gold once a fool was told
Right before he sold his soul his soul
and a man made his money His money was on his mind
He got everything he wanted and he still wasn't satisfied
How you feel when you look in the mirror do you see a champion or a weakling
What's your thing what you chasing falsehood or fatherhood
Abandonment of parenthood I'm looking for something good
There's something bout the way you act the way you play the game
I love you smile and you don't look at life quite the same
Your attitude kinda make me want to really change
Look at things not the same but differently
You the best the worst of me the reverse the opposite of me
Your hospitality got me feeling quite free
Sitting in front of the big screen watching life go by
Wanna be like what you see every time you close your eyes
She's coming in from the cold she cant stand to be alone
He's looking for a hole what she needs is a home
Hope you find what you need hope you find what you need
A religious man is preaching. Said he found god
But he couldn't go to heaven until he found love
The people they are listening he caught them by surprise
He Confessed all his sins and he stop telling lies
I hear you wanna try to find it do you know what it is
I hear you go looking for what you want i hope you find what you need
I hear you gonna try to find it do you know what it is
I hear you go looking for what you want hope you find what you need
Hope you find what you need
Hey yo push come to shove what happen to the love
What happen to the giving instead of taking my heart is breaking
To many greedy not giving to the needy
What happen to the pity when you walk through the inner city
Now where the love at where the hugs at
Nowadays everybody want to be a thug act
Too many materialistic ways and nowadays nobody love each other the same way
Everyone's trying to find it Do we know what it is
hear we go looking for what we want I hope we find what we need
Everyone's trying to find it Do we know what it is
I hear we go looking for what we want I hope we find what we need
I Hope you find what you need hope you find what you need
One time and if the blind lead the blind then wha go happen to the whole mankind
You nuh know me say hope you find what you need
Ziggy ziggy ziggy and heavy heavy heavy and Ziggy Ziggy Ziggy them no ready ready

When I'm smoking my pipe
When I'm troddin' the earth
When I'm driving the road
When they dig pits in my way
When they try to keep me down

Even in the darkest night
Selassie I, he is my light
Jah is always there by my side
Though, sometimes, I lose my way
Jah say: "You'll be found one day"
He is always there by my side
Sometimes, I feel like a ship lost at sea
Is there anyone looking out for me?
Voice in the wilderness bawling, please
Please, don't let me fall, 'cause sometimes
I feel like a bird with broken wings
Being led away in the coldest wind
Who's gonna teach me to fly again? Oh, no
Look at the lillies in the field, they don't spin
But the King of kings provides for them, oh
And if the King of the kings still sits on the throne
Then, I know that I am never alone
Even in the darkest night
Selassie I, he is my light
Jah is always there by my side, yeah
Though, sometimes, I lose my way
Jah say: "You'll be found one day"
He is always there by my side, by my side
Mamma, don't you worry
Jah, Jah never leaves me (By my side)
He is always there (By my side)
Mamma, don't you worry
Jah, Jah never leaves me (By my side)
He is always there (By my side)
That's why I
Give thanks everyday when I and I rise
Though everyday's not a day with a bright sky
And, when darkness bring pain to my eye sight
Jah is the light on my way and he shines bright (Jah!)
Power a di Trinity
So, I never question: Jah, Jah divinity
If you ever doubt Selassie I abilities
Look inna yourself and answer this: tell me
Who taught the birda how to fly?
Who is the one that hangs the clouds in the sky?
And if for Moses, Jah did part the Red Sea, yeah
Then, I know that Jah is always with me
Always with me
Even in the darkest night
Selassie I, he is my light
Jah is always there by my side
And, though, sometimes, I lose my way
Jah say: "You'll be found one day" (Jah say)
He is always there by my side, by my side (I'll find you, my son, find you)
Mamma, don't you worry

Deep down in Jamaica, close to Mandeville
Back up in the woods, on top of a hill
There stood an old hut made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
He never learned to read and a-write so well
But he could play his guitar like ringing a bell, yell
Go, Johnny, Johnny B. Goode tonight
Go, Johnny, Johnny B. Goode tonight
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Sitting in a tree in the railroad track
Old engineer in the train sitting in the shade
Strummin' with the rhythm that them drivers made
People passing by would stop and say
Oh my, oh my, what the boy can play
Go, Johnny, Johnny B. Goode tonight
Go, Johnny, Johnny B. Goode tonight
Mama said: Son, you gotta be a man
You gotta be the leader of a reggae band
People coming in from miles around
To hear you play until the sun goes down
Boy, someday, your name will be in the lights
Saying: Johnny B. Goode tonight
Go, Johnny, Johnny B. Goode tonight
Go, Johnny, Johnny B. Goode tonight

They call me Johnny Cool Man
They call me Johnny Cool Man
I wake up soon and I feel so good
And home just don't bother me
They call me Johnny Cool, Cool, Cool. Cool Man
They call me Johnny Cool Man
But sticks and stones may break my bones
And words just don't bother me
I was on the other hand
They take me for the other man
But sticks and stones can break my bones
And words just don't bother, bother me
They call me Johnny Cool Man
They call me Johnny Cool Man
But sticks and stones may break my bones
And words just don't bother me
They said some things to make me change
They said some things to make me feel bad
But sticks and stones can break my bones
And words just don't bother me

And most of di youth dem a all turn dancers
Policeman weh shoot you, a leave you unconscious
Garrisons been losing sponsor
Cah most politician flake out like dandruff
Now court indictment a spread like cancers
And even the baby a tun inna monster
Road hot, Kingfish do want answers
Rollin up in unmarked kingfish and lancers
A patrol increase due to circumstances
This year mi hear di man a not keep champions
[Hook:]
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Don't trust even your close companions
Mi heard of armagideon deep like canyons
[Chorus:]
So all the criminals at large
Or criminal weh large
Ah rob di country blind and di corruption camouflage
And if the streets could eva talk
What's really going on
Whole heap a people would be wanted
So all the criminals at large
Or criminal weh large
Ah rob di country blind and di corruption camouflage
And if the streets could eva talk
What's really going on
Whole heap a people would be wanted
[Verse 2:]
Check it
Things just ain't the same for hustlers
Informers and busters living amongst us
Now every man face deh pon posters
Cyan trust people who are the closest
Hey squaddy you've been losing focus
To protect and serve cah you more provoke us
You lock off the dance when you should support us
Reggae entrepreneur dancehall promoters
Things happen for the strangest reasons
Most of the artist cyan get Visas
And now time tuffa dan Tamarind season
Dem nah reap nuh corna and di fowl waan feeding
[Hook:]
Things just ain't the same for gangstas

[Verse 3:]
Check it hey
The whole country a strap you blame us
Now that the violence get outrageous
For minimum wages some young teenagers
Cyar 12 gauges and waan be famous
Don't do a politician favours
They comin all size colour, shapes and flavours
And dem introduce to violent behaviours
And push come to shove not even dem can save us
Watch di outcome how all these capers
Dem sell more pages in more newspapers
You read dem and burn dem dem turn to vipers
Meanwhile di youths dem locked in cages
[Hook:]

Worlds all changing
They trying to change us too
I might be going crazy
What am I to do
Keep my faith
Walls crumble around me
I'm not surprised
What could I do
When you took my rights
Keep my faith
Like forty days and forty nights
In this wilderness of life
I am tempted
Frustration stirs up strife
Oh no no
Keep my faith
Circle around the sun
The signs are in the skies
The day will come
After the night
Mama say
Keep my faith, what you gonna do
Daddy say Lord
Keep my faith
Jah Jah say now
Keep my faith
People say
Keep my faith
Nothing they can do
Keep my faith

Could be down in the trenches
Could be down in the trenches
Keep my faith
Could down on my last breath
Keep my faith
One more thing Jim
Walls crumble around me
I am not surprised
There's nothing I could do
When they took my rights but
What you say
Keep my faith
Jah Jah, keep my faith
What you gonna do
Jah I keep my faith
I'll keep my faith
What you gonna do
Keep my faith

When you left me, I didn't cry, but my heart was heavy
as heavy as lead
I sit there thinking with no thoughts in my head
I could not be comforted, by the living or the dead
So I keep on dreaming to communicate
and I keep on dreaming if that's what it take
keep on dreaming, it's never too late
keep on dreaming, cause that's what it take
I see you in my visions, and it seems you're right here
I wish I didn't have to wake up, but here comes the light of day
it's been too long now, since you went away
won't you come back, so we can play
[Chorus]
I knew it wasn't over, it was only the start
cause I see the light that shines in the dark
the questions have answers, my love isn't lost
fate put us together, so nothing can tear us apart
[Chorus]

She wrote me a letter
In the early days of December
Saying she wasn't happy
Where she was
Oh that's the bad news yeah
That is why today I'm here
To take her away from you
Everytime you treat her badly
It brings back memories and
We don't want
To see her go through
Hurt again so!
[Chorus:]
Keep on knocking but you
Can't come in now
She's my mother you know
If she was a bad mother
She would have thrown us away
Long time ago
Even when things got bad
She still held onto us all the way
When she cries we cry too
When she smiles we smile too
We were happy all this time
Until you came along
Everytime you treat her badly
It brings back memories and
We don't want to see her
Go through hurt again
[Chorus: till fade]

And man one desert a done and still cannot afford a pair
Cannot find nuh vasoline fi moisturize dem daughter hair
And the bulla price a rise and it nuh dearer than the pear
An' a so mi get fi know seh heads a government nuh care
Cause the money them a share, a crate a Guiness, crate a beer
Cannot pay your little pickney school fee come to end a year
Tell the youth dem seh fi get them education and prepare

She wanted to be
Like her mother in many ways
The way she walks
The way she smiles
Over and above all
The way she brushes her hair back
She heard it all being said to her
Saw it all happening in her life
Like every woman
She's been trapped in this
Fairy tale
Find a frog, kiss it,
And hope it would turn
Into a handsome prince
How many frogs has she kissed
In her life?
None of them turned into
A handsome prince
The little girl made a decision
In her life ohh
And she promised to keep it
[Chorus:]
I'm gonna kiss no frog
Everything went
The way she wanted
Every dream was what she wanted
But when it came to finding someone
To spend her life with
Same old story
Find a frog, kiss it
And hope it'll turn into a prince ohh
Better to be alone and be happy
Than being with someone
And be unhappy
All your life
[Chorus:]
I'm gonna kiss no frog
[Till fade]

And if you drink rum and tumble down
You alone go and have your fun

Leave my business, leave my business
Leave my business and mind your own

Some things are just never said, no
Oooh ooh ooh
Woah woah, yeah
Story of my life
Ordinary person just like you
If you take a look inside
You'll see the great things that people do
Changing lives day and night
But nothing I do ever makes the news
Still I have to do what's right
To the King of all kings, all praise is due
Yesterday I was on the train
A little boy asked me my name
He said sir I've seen you before tell me who are you?
Said I am a legend that you never heard of before
I said I am a lion but you never heard me roar
I am a hero that nobody celebrates
But if one person remembers my name, that means I made a change
I'm the man who cooks the food and feed the street people in the afternoon
I'm the lady with the broom sweeping the halls of your sons pre-school
I'm the soldier who's up all night, making sure everything's alright
And if you ask me I'm quite fine being a ordinary person doing what's right
Yesterday at the football game
A little girl asked me my name
She said sir I've seen you before, tell me who are you
Said I am a legend that you never heard of before
Said I am a lion but you never heard me roar
I am a hero that nobody celebrates
But if one person remembers my name, that means
I'm the ocean of fame
I'm an unknown sailor
I'm the percussionist playing with the Wailers
The one with the shaker, the mover and shaker
My name wasn't on the front of the paper
But mi nuh care cah
Much more than the work cah the work is greater
Creation glorifies Creator
So all deeds done are in the name of my Maker
I am a legend that you probably never hear about
Words from the lion's mouth
I am a hero that nobody celebrates
But if one person remembers my name
Give praise, that means I made a change
Legend, legend
I am a legend
Story of my life
Ordinary person just like you
If you take a look inside
You'll see the great things that people do
We out here changing lives day and night, day in day out
BBC don't show it
CNN don't show it
Ease out

I've learned some lessons in my life
Always be careful of mankind
They'll make you promises today
But tomorrow they change their mind
But I'm an upfull man
And I love upfull people
I'm a progressive man
And I love progressive people
I'm a truthful man
And I love truthful people
I'm an honest man
And I love honest people
I've learned some lessons in my life
Always be careful of my friends
Money can make friendship end
But I'm an upfull man
And I love upfull people
I'm a progressive man
And I love progressive people
I'm an honest man
I love honest people
I'm an intelligent man
And I love intelligent people
I'm an aggressive man
And I love aggressive people
I'm a fire man
And I love the fire people
But I'm an upfull man
And I love upfull people
I'm an intelligent man
And I love intelligent people
I'm a progressive man
And I love progressive people

Let it go
Let your body go 
When the music flow
Got nothing to lose
When we're dancing to the music
It's a vibration 
A sensation
A natural mystic 
All around
Coming to you from above
Coming to you from underground
Let it go
Let your body go 
When the music flow
Got nothing to lose
When we're dancing to the music
Let it go, you've got to let it go
Let it go, you've got to let it flow
Sometimes we just got to let go
Of everything we think we know
Sometimes we just got to be free
No one telling us how we should be
Let it go
Let your body go 
When the music flow
I got nothing to lose
When I'm dancing to the music
Just call me music
And don't call me nothing else
All your might
Say we dancing through the night
With all your might
Say we grooving through the night
Sometimes you just got to let go
Of everything you think we know
Sometimes we just got to be free
No one telling us how we should be
Let it go
Let your body go 
Let it go
A sensation, a natural mystic
Let your body go
Let it go now
Free your soul now
Let it go

We've got the wind that blows every day,
We've got the moon and the stars that gives us light every day.
We've got the wind that blows every day,
We've got the moon and the stars that gives us light in the dark.
We've got life, we've got clothes,
But at the corners of our minds we've got a question.
And the question is, where do all these things come from?
This world is turning around but we don't know how it happens.
The world is turning around but we don't know how it happens.
Only God knows.
Let Jah be praised. [x6]
The world is turning around, but we don't know how it happens.
They say the world is turning around, but we don't know how it happens.
Only God knows.
We see the flowers and the trees,
They are growing out there where nobody cares.
They've got life, they've got energy,
But at the corners of our minds we've got a question.
And the question is, where do all these things come from?
Ooh, nobody knows.
We are living in this world that's turning around, but we don't know how it happens.
The world is turning around but we don't know how...
Only God knows.
Let Jah be Praised [x12]
(Let him be praised, whoever you are, whatever you may do
Igziabeher, Negusa Negast praise the Lord.
I said praise.)
The world is turning around, but we don't know how it happens.
The world is turning around, but we don't know how it happens.
Oh Jah, Jah...
We've got the wind that blows every day...

Wooh Yeah

To get over you baby
Mmhmmm
Let me down easy
Give me time
To get over you baby
Mmmhmmm
Break it to me gently
If htis is goodbye
(Baby say it slow)
Cause you taught me to love you
So come on girl and teach me not to love you before you go
Oh cause the fall from the top
To the bottom
Is such a sudden drop
So let me down easy
Give me time
To get over you baby
Mmmhmm
Let me down easy
Give me time
To get over you baby
Mmhmmm
Don't turn the lights out on me
Let the fell of love slowly fade away
Let your sweeter sister know
And you're loving arms a little tender day by day
Oh cause the fall
From the top
To the bottom
Is such a sudden drop
So let me down easy
Give me time
To get over you baby
Let me down easy
Give me time to get over you baby
Let me down easy
Give me a lil love girl
Give me time to get over you
Just a little more time
Let me down easy baby

Even though his times are hard
You can hardly see it on his face
Because of the smile
People coming in from miles away
To hear him sing and see him play
So he can't disappoint them now
The room is full of smoke
But he can see them dancing
And he can see them crying
It doesn't bother him at all
'Cause he knows it's only tears of joy
[Chorus:]
Let the band play on
There's a girl sitting by the corner there
And she looks at him with her big brown eyes
He smiles back and carries on playing
It doesn't bother him at all
Somehow, it gives him some comfort
Police came in halfway through the night
With the good news
Neighbours are complaining
'Cause the music is so low low low low
So turn it up, now
[Chorus:]
Let the band play on

You keep telling me yes 
But you don't mean it 
You keep telling me no 
And try to lean it 
You're giving me buts and maybe 
You know this will drive me crazy 
Why can't you tell it like it is? 
And let your yeah be yeah 
And your no be no, now 
Let your yeah be yeah 
And your no be no, now 
Because I'm on my guard and 
I'm watching you from head to toe 
So that let your yeah be yeah 
And your no be no 
You wear a plastic smile 
I know by your eyes 
You speak with indefinite style 
You're telling me lies 
You've got to face reality 
What is wrong with you and me? 
Why can't you free your honesty? 
And let your yeah be yeah 
And your no be no, now 
Let your yeah be yeah 
And your no be no, now 
Because I'm on my guard and 
I'm watching you from head to toe 
So you better let your yeah be yeah 
And your no be no 
You keep telling me yes 
But you don't mean it 
You keep telling me no 
And try to lean it 
You're giving me buts and maybe 
You know this will drive me crazy 
Why can't you tell it like it is? 
You better let your yeah be yeah 
And your no be no, now 
Let your yeah be yeah 
And your no be no, now

Ah, ah
I want to dance with you, all night long
My arms want to hold you, all night long
As we embrace and your heart came close to mine
I get so excited, I could cry
I want to feel your lips resting by mine
As we swing and sway down the line
I can see the love light shining in your eyes
I get so excited, I could cry
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
I want to dance with you, all night long
Caress me darling, with all your charms
As we embrace and your heart came close to mine
I get so excited, I could cry
Let me hold your hand all night long
Put your arms around me, hold me strong
I want to dance with you, all night long
Dance with you, all night long
As we embrace and your heart came close to mine
I get so happy, I could cry
Ah, ah, hmm-mmm

Is this real love I feel tonight
When you kiss me and hold me tight
How can I tell
I've got to be sure
If this is love we could enjoy
So come on
Let's sing in this party
Oh lordy miss Dotty
Everything will be alright
People say that I am in love
But they can see it in my eyes
You're the prettiest girl I ever seen
Let's go see about another party
Let's jump, let's jump
Let's jump, let's jump, let's jump, let's jump
Is this real love I feel tonight
When you kiss me and hold me tight
How can I tell
I've got to be sure
If this is love we could enjoy
So come on
Let's sing in this party
Oh lordy miss Dotty
Everything will be alright
People say that I am in love
But they can see it in my eyes
You're the prettiest girl I ever seen
Let's go see about another party
Let's jump, let's jump
Let's jump, let's jump, let's jump, let's jump
Let's jump, let's jump
Let's jump, let's jump, let's jump, let's jump

Warning, this is the chief of police speaking,
Do not steal Police hate competition.
Where we gonna run
Where we gonna hide
You've got the right to remain silent,
But forever they were brought here to protect us
They were brought here not to hurt
But now they hurt us everyday
You see, police have joined forces
With criminals
Don't steal, police hate competition.
We can't sit down - something must be done
Catching the bad guys in real life
Is not as easy as it is in the movies.
We see James Bond (007)
Eddie Murphy (Beverly Hills Cop)
Chasing bad guys all the time
But police in real life
Have joined forces with criminals
Don't steal, police hate competition
We can't sit down - something must be done.
Our life has got to be like
Life in the movies
Where the good guys always
Win in the end
[Chorus]
Life in the movies
How can we expect them
To serve and protect
The community, if they themselves
Are the bad guys
Police have joined forces with criminals
Stand up and fight, no one is safe
[Chorus: till fade]

Hey sister, the emotions have gone cold
And a part of me is missing,
Where the rivers used to flow
Hey mother, I know you must be sad
To see the things are happening
I'll fix it if I can
I'm holding up the fire
Lighting up the sky
Like a lighthouse on the ocean,
Bring you home alright
I'm holding up the fire (Holding up the fire)
Lighting up the sky (Lighting up the sky)
Like a lighthouse on the ocean,
Bring you home alright
Hey brother, some things never change
Caesar's always Caesar, and night comes into day
Hey father, they sold you like a slave
To a world that takes everything,
And gives nothing away
I'm holding up the fire
Lighting up the sky
Like a lighthouse on the ocean,
Bring you home alright
I'm holding up the fire (Holding up the fire)
Lighting up the sky (Lighting up the sky)
Like a lighthouse on the ocean,
Bring you home alright
Yeah, I'm holding up the fire
Lighting up the sky
Like a lighthouse on the ocean,
Bring you home alright
I'm holding up the fire (Holding up the fire)
Lighting up the sky (Lighting up the sky)
Like a lighthouse on the ocean,
I'll bring you home alright
Holding up the fire,
I'm lighting up the sky
Like a lighthouse on the ocean,
I bring your home alright
Holding up the fire,
I'm lighting up the sky
Like a lighthouse on the ocean,
I bring your home alright
I'm holding up the fire,
Oh one love

See and I know concept of rasta mean righteousness.
You talkin' about lion, iron, but you can't go to zion
Talkin' about lion, iron, but you far from zion
I only hear you words
But I don't see no works
You think my father's a fool
You never get away
No matter what you say
Cause you have broken my father's rule
And then you come around, lion, iron, but you can't go to zion
Talkin' 'bout lion, iron, but you far from zion
Knots on your head
Talkin' 'bout you dread
And you believe, that is all
Long hair on your face
And your works is disgrace
You and the wicked them must fall
And then you talk about lion, iron, but you can't go to zion
Talkin' 'bout lion, iron, but you far from zion
Preach lot in the days
And you kill in the nights
And you believe, that is right
Put down your gun
Or your days will be done
You won't be around, to have no fun
So I am the lion, iron, and I must go to zion
I am the lion, iron, and I must go to zion
I am the lion, iron, and I must go to zion
Cause I am the lion, iron, and I must go to zion
No bet you, lion, iron, and I must go to zion
I am the lion, iron, and I must go to zion
Cause I am the lion, iron, and I must go to zion

Well, I've been thinking lately much of my baby
Thinking how she needs me, yeah
And I don't see you know if she's feeling so bad
Feeling so bad, feeling so bad
Maybe it's better
If I forget her
Let her go on
How I long to hold her tenderly
How I long to hold her close to me
Maybe someday she will change her mind
And let me taste her lips of wine
Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine in the morning
Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine in the evening
Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine in the morning
Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine
Maybe it's better if
I forget her
Let her go on
How I long to her hold her tenderly
How I long to hold her close to me
Maybe someday she will change her mind
And let me taste her lips of wine
Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine in the morning
Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine in the evening
Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine in the morning
Lips of wine, woah, woah
Lips of wine

And I wake up in the mornin'
With my hair down in my eyes and she says "hi"
And I stumble to the breakfast table
While the kids are goin' off to school... goodbye
And she reaches out and takes my hand
And squeezes it and says "How ya feelin', hon?"
And I look across at smilin' lips
That warm my heart and see my mornin' sun
And if that's not lovin' me, then all I've got to say
God didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And there's no such thing as Mother Seuss
Or Disneyland, and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme
Jah didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime
And when myself is feelin' low
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind
Sometimes I call her up at home knowin' she's busy
And ask her if she could get away and meet me
And maybe we could grab a bite to eat
And she drops what she's doin'
And she hurries down to meet me and I'm always late
But she sits waitin' patiently
And smiles when she first sees me
'Cause she's made that way
And if that's not lovin' me, then all I've got to say
Jah didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the wintertime
And there's no such thing as Mother Seuss
Or Disneyland, and Mother Goose, no nursery rhyme
Jah didn't make little green apples
And it don't rain in Indianapolis in the wintertime
And when myself is feelin' low
I think about her face aglow and ease my mind

Little heroes, go down
The drain day by day
Future leaders they go down
The drains day by day
They cry so loud yeah
But the whole world
Is not listening
Only you mothers of the world
Can save the children
There's a lot of things
To be legalized yeah
But abortion is not an
Important thing here
How can you have a face
Of an angel
And let the devil inside of you
Take control
We tired of hearing these
Little voices crying out
From far away saying
[Chorus:]
Mama why do you
Destroy me
Mama what have I done
To you
I deserve to live like
Anybody else
We all come in this world
Not knowing where we gonna go
We all come in this world
Not knowing where life is
Gonna take us
Give them a chance in life
We're all taking our changes here
Life life life the greatest gift of all
I see the government officials
Sitting around a table
There's a law they gonna pass
Only you the mothers of
The world can save the children
Women's leagues
All over the world
Fighting for women's liberation
But who fights for
The children's liberation
We are tired of hearing
These little voices saying
[Chorus: till fade]

My resistance is getting weaker
I can't stand the pressure
I can't get any weaker
I've got to find some other treature
I need nothing to be a man
Because I was born a man
And I deserve the rights to live
Like any other man
My mind in such a state
Sometimes it makes me sick
Sometimes I try to ate
But I just don't know the trick
I need nothing to be a man
Because I was born a man
And I deserve the rights to live
Like any other man
Experience costs you wisdom
The tought I got some let
I'm getting out for certain
My soul can stand the test
I need nothing to be a man
Because I was born a man
And I deserve the rights to live
Like any other man
My resistance is getting weaker
I can't stand the pressure
I can't get any weaker
I've got to find some other treature
I need nothing to be a man
Because I was born a man
And I deserve the rights to live
Like any other man
My mind in such a state
Sometimes it makes me sick
Sometimes I try to ate
But I just don't know the trick
I need nothing to be a man
Because I was born a man
And I deserve the rights to live
Like any other man
Experience costs you wisdom
The tought I got some let
I'm getting out for certain
My soul can stand the test
I need nothing to be a man
Because I was born a man
And I deserve the rights to live
Like any other man

If life means what it means to me
Happiness come from the way we live
Not the money we receive
'Cause even the poor man is rich
Love in our hearts
Health strength and longevity
Live it up
Live it up don't give it up
...
If right means what it means to me
Before words were spoken
Jah law was written within
If right means what it means to you
What the preacher say is not what the preach do
Live it up
Live it up don't give it up
...
Life for me
Life for you life for me
Life for you
...
There is no owner's manual for the life that we lead
Learn as you grow
More power to you
In life there's many stages but don't you quit
'Cause when the table turn more power to you
More power to you
Good now
Everyone feeling

Some of the rich men get their riches from the ghetto
As far as I can see
All the poor ones, that live in the ghetto
They put all their trust in vanity
And that's why, the rich ones shall be richer
And the poor ones shall be poorer
That's how it goes, that's where it's at
You must first see the kingdom of Zion
Then all things will be hurried unto you
You will never want, hungering or thirsting
You will feed off this cup of life
And then you will weep no more
Know that it's God and God and God alone
That set us free from our misery
Really set us free
You sick with your soul brother
You sick with your soul sister
I say, you wrong with my God
It's not my God, wrong with you
You sick with your soul brother
You sick with your love sister
I say, you wrong with my God
It's not my God, wrong with you
You must first sit in the kingdom of Zion
Then all things, will be hurried unto you
You will never want, hungering or thirsting
You will feed off this cup of life
And then you will know yourself
And know that it's love and purity, that set us free
That set us free from all this misery

But the sunshine never comes through
You know it’s always dark and dreary
Since I broke off, baby, with you
I live on Lonely Avenue
My little girl wouldn’t say ‘I do’
So I’ll try, I’ll try, I’ll try
Yes, I’ll cry, I’ll cry, I’ll cry
Someone hear me, Lord
Now my covers, they feel like lead
And my pillow, it feels like stone

Mystic smiles on faces wild
Comic styles but their faces don't glow

There was no love, no, no love to be found

Let me tell you now
Has now been revealed
In the broad, in the broad daylight
So, you better look before you leap
Still water runs deep
And what you sow you will reap
'Cause you're the one who's gonna weep
And I know you will reap what you sow
Yes, I know you will reap what you sow
Arise from out of your slumber
Or your days will surely be numbered, now
Don't just sit there waiting on time
Because time will leave you behind
You better look before you leap
Still water runs deep
And what you sow you will reap
'Cause you're the one who's gonna weep
And I know you will reap what you sow
Yes, I know you will reap what you sow
Yeah
Look before you leap

My frustration won't subside I've been tried time after time
But it's not my style to quit there is more to life than this
In obscurity or fame we're all playing in this game
Searching for something searching for something
Looking, looking, looking, you will find find you will be fine
Saturday in the morning and the rain kept falling
Brother didn't get no sleep now he's really feeling beat
But there is no time to waste as the devil test his faith
He just walks away on a mission to complete
Looking, looking, looking, you will find find you will be fine
Looking oh find you will be fine
She has her hand on her jaw as she wonders away
What will tomorrow bring will her dreams just disappear
She find words are hard to say so she prays everyday
She must find a way may the pieces fall into place
Frustration won't subside I've been tried time after time
But it's not my style to quit there is more to life than this
In obscurity or fame we're all playing in this game
Searching for something searching for something
Looking, looking, looking, you will find find you will be fine
Looking, looking, looking, you will find find you will be fine
Searching for something, looking for something

Huh
An angel told me that Jah is hearing our prayer each day
Regardless of our faith
And even though so many of his children stray
Our good deeds are never wasted
And so believe it or not, you're special in your own way
And your existence is a must
Within the heart of Jah everyone has their space
Even the dogs have a purpose
Oh, looks are deceiving you
Now don't you underrate yourselves, no
Oh, looks are deceiving you
Now don't you underrate yourselves
Then I said, "Angel, the world is such an ugly state
How will we make it out?
Man and woman seem to certainly have lost their way
Our little hearts are full of hatred
Now it appears that we're way in over our heads
And we're in dire need of help
'Cause there's no way that we can right all these wrongs by ourselves"
The angel only said
Man, looks are deceiving you
Now don't you underrate yourselves
Oh, looks are deceiving you
Now don't you underrate yourselves, no
Oh, looks are deceiving mankind
So feel good about yourself
Oh, looks are deceiving mankind
Oh, always be proud of yourself
Then I said, "Angel, the people are consumed by sin
And we no longer love His laws
A generation that's all but forgotten 'bout Him
Rebels without a cause"
The angel told me the Judgement we face is real
Only if we choose to believe it
Jah love us all too much to ever let us burn in hell
They had to keep that one a secret
Oh, looks are deceiving you
Now don't you underrate yourselves, no
Oh, looks are deceiving mankind
Feel good about
Oh, looks are deceiving you
Now don't you underrate yourself, no
Oh, looks are deceiving you
Always be proud of yourself
'Cause looks are deceiving you
Don't you underrate yourselves, no
Oh, looks are deceiving you
Please feel good about yourself, yeah
Oh, looks are deceiving you
Don't you underrate yourself, no
Looks are deceiving mankind
Don't you underrate
Don't you give up on yourself
Please don't you give up on yourselves, no
Now don't you give up on yourself

Tyrants come for us to come
Oh oh, we woman we have just began
Once upon a time we were put up slaves
But we will not die in x again
All the youth shall [?] if we lead the way
And we comin' for, a brighter day
Wicked aferon?
Lord!...
So much pain we have received
Don't lead the children to disbelief
Lord!...

through the books and bibles of time I've made up my mind
I don't condemn, I don't convert, this is a calling have you heard
bring all the lovers to the fold, cause no one is gonna lose their soul
[Chorus:]
Love is my religion (Love is my religion) 
Love is my religion (Love is my religion)
Love is my religion
hey you can take it or leave it, and you don't have to believe it
I don't want to fight, hey let's go fly a kite
there's nothing that we can't cure, and I'll keep you in my arms for sure
so don't let nobody stop us, free spirits have to soar
with you I share the gift, the gift that we now know oh oh oh
[Chorus]
Well I'm done searching now, I found out what this life is worth
not in the books that I find, but by searching my mind
I don't condemn, I don't convert
this is the calling have you heard, bring all the lovers to the fold
no one is gonna lose their soul
Love is my religion (Love is my religion)
Love is my religion (Love is my religion)
Love is my religion
Hey you can take it or leave, and you dont have to believe it
[Chorus: fades out]

Listen darlin'
Now who's gonna hold and squeeze me tight
Now that she's gone out of my life
Who's gonna make me feel the way she used to do, yeah
Now that my love is overdue
Now that my love is overdue
I'm all alone in the wilderness
Searching to find some peace and rest
Although she wasn't the best girl
But she brought happiness into my world
And now I'm a prison of loneliness
Said I'm a prison of loneliness
That's what I am
Now whose voice is gonna say goodnight
Now that she's gone out of my sight
Who's gonna tell me lies and let me think they're true
Now that my love is overdue
Now that my love is overdue
Can you see right now
And I don't know just what to do, yeah
Now whose voice is gonna say goodnight
Now that she's gone out of my sight
Who's gonna tell me lies and let me think they're true
Now that my love is overdue
Now that my love is overdue
Can you see right now
And I don't know just what to do, yeah

He built this wall around himself
Many years ago
To protect himself from being hurt again
But he couldn't stop his feelings
Last night yeah
When he saw the young lady in the bar
Blonde hair, blue eyes
Waited till the band played the last song
And took her home
His mother didn't like her
His father didn't like her
The only thing that kept them
Going was knowing that
Love would conquer all
[Chorus:]
They were lovers
In a dangerous time
They ran away to another country
'Cause they thought things would be
Better for them out there
In the month of December
They got married in Chicago
And it was all the same
Everywhere they went
Heads would turn
[Chorus: till fade]

I'm not in a position to maintain you
The way that you're accustomed to
Can't take you out to fancy places
Like other fellows that I know can do
I'm only able to romance you
And make you tingle with delight
Financially, I'm a pauper
But when it comes to lovin', I'm alright
Alright, alright
Don't show me what you're friends are wearing
I really don't want to see
Don't tell me what your friends are buying, girl
'Cause money doesn't grow on trees
I got so many patches on my clothes, girl
A hole in the bottom of my shoe
Financially, I'm a pauper
But when it comes to lovin', I'm alright
Alright, alright
You do really think, I can buy you girl
Or drive you in a GT car
If you're hungry, girl, I can't feed you
For my money, girl, you won't get far
Tell me 'bout the things, that excite you
That makes you tingle with delight
Tell me where to hold and touch you
So you got to tell me, I'm alright
Alright, alright

I say, I feel the loving spirit deep down in my soul
Let me ask you about something brother
Can you feel it? Yes, I feel it
Can you feel that spirit now? Yes, I feel it
Though he washed my people's slate
And he make it white as snow
He plant his footsteps on the sea
And he rides upon a star
So consecrate this now
I say, I got the loving spirit deep down in my soul
I say, I feel the loving spirit deep down in my soul
This is such a situation deep down in my soul
Can you feel it? Yes, I feel it
Can you feel the spirit? Yes, I feel it

Praise god I say, praise god each day
He helped me to overcome
I remember once I couldn't get out of bed
So I sing and say... yeah
Lying in bed got nothin' to do
No one to rub my head
Playing my guitar my only friend
It's gonna last me till the end
Don't wanna land it
Wanna get out instead
I wanna feel free with activity
Above my bed bob face us all
Looking at me so passionately
Well in his eyes I saw the truth
The truth of a rastaman
The truth of a higher man
To the bridge
Don't wanna land it
Wanna get out instead
I wanna feel free with activity
Well I got lots and lots of company yeah
Alot of good vibes flowing around me
Nurses coming and wondering, o god
Is this really Ziggy Marley
Lying in bed got nothin' to do
No one to rub my head
Strumming my guitar my only friend
It's gonna last me till the end
Above my bed bob face us all, my daddy
Looking at me so passionately, lil brother
Well in his eyes I saw the truth, my name
The truth of a rastaman
The truth of a higherman
Rastafari no, I n I give praises
I n I thank Jah for, his health
If it was not for him
What would I, what would I've done
So I say amen
Don't wanna land it
Wanna get out instead
I wanna feel free with activity
Don't wanna land it
Wanna get out instead
I wanna feel free with activity
Don't wanna land it
Wanna get out instead
I wanna feel free with activity

[INTRO VOICE 1]
Scholars and scientists now conceive that Africa is the first place of mankind
Africans were the first builders of civilization
They discovered mathematics, invented writing, developed sciences
Engineering, medicine, religion, fine arts, and built the Great Pyramids
An architectural achievement which still baffles modern scientists'
[INTRO VOICE 2]
The 225th Emperor [echo] direct descent from Solomon and The Queen of Sheba [echo]
He is the "King of Kings, The Lion of Judah [echo]"
The name Haile Selassie I means "Power of the Trinity"
[Verse 1: Stephen Marley]
Educate yourselves, of Africa
To liberate yourself, Africa
Keep your heads up high
No more will we cry
Eeeeyh
Our history that they stole, Africa
Is written in our souls, Africa
Oldest nation on this earth
Know just what you worth
Well well
Ships that sail to distant places
Robbed us of our rising worlds
History says that you've betrayed us
Talking of the Gods you serve
Hear the rambling in the sky
Tears that our fore fathers cry
And today we're still in chains
Take the shackle from our minds
You're the corner stone
The king upon the throne
How beautiful are thou, Africa
Our nation have to bow, Africa
Don't you fall from grace
You're that secret place
Aye! Aye-ah-aye!
[Verse 2: Wale]
Power to the people, Motherland representa
I'm on trial with the man she my co-defendant
And I demand her attention, can you focus women?
I'm getting closer to the sky errytime I hit it
Haile Selassie I, "Power of the Trinity"
Soul made in naija, my voice made in Italy
White mans world that I'm livin' in, some say
But it was Africa the continent we all came from
Can't nothing come between me and you
So before I have seeds gotta understand my roots
Gotta understand the truth. We is all king's 'round here
Lifes not all fair, work till we fall dead
Paul goin' hard 'till I urn like a Pall-Bearer
Although my body's in the U.S my heart's there
I can never be ashamed of her, I got my features and my name from her
Mama Africa
[Verse 3: Stephen Marley]
The richest place on earth
Know just what your worth
[HARMONIZING WITH MUSIC]
Talking about the God you serve
[HARMONIZING WITH MUSIC]
Keep your heads up high

They infiltrate our homes, Africa
They claim it as their own, Africa

The science and the art, Africa

There's so many things about you
Wondering where you are
They try their best to hide you Mama
But I search and I find you

In you there's so many kingdoms
To me it's out of sight

You're the maker of pearls
And the maker of all precious goals

Mama I don't ever want to see you cry
If then they knew him
They'd have passed right by
Oh, Joseph's a man of many women, feel no way
Oh, always remember you are the first of them
So oh Mama
If they could see where we are coming from
The other day
Then they would know just where they belong
If they could see where you're coming from
Just the other day
They would know just where they belong
Let stumbling blocks fall out of your way
Lord know, Lord knows your reward shall be great
They were broken off through their lack of faith
But because of your faith you are still in place
Woe Mama, if they could see where you're coming from
Just the other day
Then they would know just where you are coming from
If they could see where you are coming from
Just the other day
Then they would know just where they belong
Ah my children
Oh Mama
Fret not for me
I know Jah will be there
Eternally
If they could see where we are coming from
Just the other day
Then they would know just where they belong
If they could see where we are coming from
Then they would know just where they belong
Mama I don't ever want to see you cry
Ain't no lie
If then they knew him
They would have passed right by
So many called but you were chosen
And so you will remain outspoken
Oh Mama
If they could see where we are coming from
Just the other day
Then they would know just where they belong
Mama I don't ever want to see you cry
Ain't no lie
If then they knew him
They would have passed right by
So many called but you were chosen
And so you will remain outspoken
Oh Mama
If they could see where we are coming from
Just the other day
Then they would know just where they belong
If they could see where we are coming from
Just the other day
Then they would know just where they belong
Then they would know
Yes they would know

Standing alone, in the middle of the city
Man looks around him
He hardly recognises what he sees
Cause he's a man from the past
Two thousand years ago
This was his home
Rivers used to run here
Birds used to fly around here
But now it is a different jungle
A concrete jungle
[Chorus:]
He's a lonely man
In the middle of the city
Missing home so badly
Man's own creation
Has become his worst enemy
Weaplons of destruction
Have brought about
Human extinction... wo... ho
Two thousand years ago
This was his home
But now it is
A different jungle
A concrete jungle
[Chorus:]
He's a lonely man
In the middle of the city
Missing home so badly

When I look in the mirror
It's your face I see
Even when I go to sleep at night
It's your face I see
You are the one to congratulate me
When I've done right
You are the last to criticize me
When I've done wrong
You are the star of my show
Oh... man... oh... man
I don't know where to start to thank you
Everything I own I owe it to you
[Chorus:]
The man in the mirror
When there's decisions
To be made
You leave it up to me
I leave it up to you
And whatever you decide is alright with me
Some people say you're so difficult to live with
Oh my, oh my
But I know different
Follow me I'm right behind you
I don't know where how to thank you
This happiness I have
I owe it all to you
[Chorus:]
Man in the mirror...

Shall I tell you about my life
They say I'm a man of the world
I've flown across every tide
And I've seen lots of pretty girls
I guess I've got everything I need
And I wouldn't ask for more
And there's no one I'd rather be
I'd just love to say I was born, I was born
Yeah I need a good woman
To let me feel like a good man should
I don't say I'm a good man
But I'd be if I could
I can tell you about my life
And keep you amused I'm sure
About all the times that I have cried
And how I don't want to be sad anymore
I wish I was in love yeah
Yes I wish I was in love
I wish I was in love
One more time
One more time
We're just moving, moving
We're just moving, moving consciously
Yeah the reggae's moving, moving consciously

Many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering I am lost as I travel along
The white cliffs of Dover
Many rivers to cross and it's only my will
That keeps me alive
I've been licked, washed up for years and
I merely survive because of my pride.
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be on your own
My woman left and she didn't say why
Well I guess I have to try.
Many rivers to cross but just where to begin
I'm playing for time
There'll be times I find myself thinking
Of committing some dreadful crime.
I've got many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering I am lost as I travel along
The white cliffs of Dover
Many rivers to cross and it's only my will
That keeps me alive
I've been licked, washed up for years and,
I merely survive because of my pride.

Set me as a seal on your heart
Love is stronger than death
Jealousy is cruel as the grave
Love, many waters cannot quench
Many waters cannot quench
Love, many waters cannot quench
I've been searching
Now I see
I got some love inside of me
Love, many waters cannot quench
Dreams of you fill my reality
Beautiful you are my love
Your eyes are doves behind the veil
Fair as the moon
Strong as the sun
Many waters cannot quench
Love, many waters cannot quench
I've been searching
Now I see
So much love inside of you
Love, many waters cannot quench
I've been searching
Now I see
Set me as a seal on your heart
Love is stronger than death
Jealousy is cruel as the grave
Love, many waters cannot quench
Won't retreat, won't surrender
I want you to remember
Many waters cannot quench
Love, many waters cannot quench
I've stopped searching
Now I see
So much love inside of me
Love, many waters cannot quench
I've stopped searching
Now I see
So much love inside of you
Love, many waters cannot quench

He puts on a brave face every morning and every night
He goes on stage, with a big smile on his face
You split you sides with laughter
You are sitting at the edge of your seat
'Cause you want some more
Show is over; he goes home, he takes off his mask
Tears running down his face, it's unbelievable
We all have our masks on, the world is a stage
Go on tell me, what is your story
Go on don't be shy, what is your story
[Chorus:]
Behind the Mask of a clown lies a trail of tears ...
Celebrities among us, all the time
Big smiles for the cameras around
They have lives that we only dream of
But on the inside they hurt just like us
They have things, that we only see in the movies
The tears we cry, on the outside
They cry, on the inside
Just like the clown, they go home
Take off the masks
The world is a stage, go on what is your story
[Chorus:]
Behind the Mask of a clown lies a trail of tears ...

I really wanna know right now
I know you wasn't around
When I was slaving myself
Yet you seat back and relax
And you took all the wealth
Is it material things you're running after
Or is it praises that you're giving on to Rasta?
I really wanna know right now
I gave a hand onto the wicked
But I give him it with caution
Well, I was giving love
He was seeking for reaction, tell me
Is it material things you're running after
Or is it praises that you're giving on to Rasta?
I really wanna know right now
Yes, I really wanna know right now
Oh mister wicked
I know you wasn't around
When I was slaving myself, oh gosh
Yet you seat back and relax
And you took all the wealth
Is it material things you're running after
Or is it praises you are giving on to Rasta, please?
I really wanna know right now
Really wanna know right now
You put Jah trust in vanity
And forget about your liberty
But I really wanna know right now
Now we get to understand
You are just a material man
And now we get to know right now
Really wanna know right now
Now we get to understand
That you're just a material man
Hey, mister wicked

Cultivated in love and she's not grown for greed
She's everything I want and also all I need

Everything in life has its purpose
Find its reason it has its season

Deep down I feel pain
But I know I must rise again
From this melancholy mood melancholy mood
Melancholy mood I eat for my food melancholy mood

Wooh tell her how my heart just breaks, in two
Since she journeyed far..
And even though her dreams of fame fell through
To me she will always be a star
It's a year since she was here, woo;

And take a message to Martha, message to Martha
Tell her I miss her more each day
As her train pulled out, down the track
Martha promised she'll soon be coming back, woo, yea!
Wooh, fly away, Kentucky bluebird;

Behind him he could hear
Those innocent voices
Crying out so bitterly saying
We did not start the war But we fighting now
We did not start the fire
But we burning now
They were told many years ago that their country is free
But they didn't understand

Billy old Billy [x2]
Man with the words of wisdom
They found his long black coat
On the banks of the river
'Cause he never came back
In it's pocket they found notes
He' d written some time ago
About his so called friends
It read...
Love all your friends
But never trust any one of them
Which got me thinking about
My very own friends
[Chorus:]
Mirror mirror on the wall
Who is the deadliest of them all
I ask you now-tears in my eyes
Billy old Billy [x2]
Man with the words of wisdom
See them coming
Hear them talk
Never believe a word they say
He told me one day
Even behind the smile
That he wore on his wrinkled face
Everyday
You could see the scars
Of hurt from the past
Which got me thinking of
My very own so called friend
[Chorus]

Roses are red, violets are blue
Believe me, I love you
Let's not be apart 'cause you're the rose of my heart
And sweet rose, you are my queen
You're my Miss Jamaica
My Miss Jamaica
You're my Miss Jamaica
I'm crowning you myself
Although you may not have such a fabulous shape
To suit the rest of the world
But you do suit me and that's all I want to know
I need not know nothing more
You're my Miss Jamaica
My Miss Jamaica
You're my Miss Jamaica
I'm crowning you myself
Although you may not have such a fabulous shape
To suit the rest of the world
But you do suit me and that's all I want to know
I need not know nothing more
You're my Miss Jamaica
My Miss Jamaica
You're my Miss Jamaica
I'm crowning you myself
'Cause my Miss Jamaica
Miss Jamaica
Miss Jamaica

If you didn't love me, you should have let me know
Instead of letting me stay in darkness
If you didn't want me, you should have let me know
Instead of letting me stay in darkness
You told your friends that your love steal away mine
'Cause you want to hurry on to make a date
For a big scandalize
You told your friends that your love steal away mine
'Cause you want to hurry on to make a date
For a big married life
Oh, oh, oh, you make me love you
You make me love you
Tell me why, tell me why?
You let me love you, you make me love you, oh, yeah
Keep on missing you, missing you, missing you
Everywhere I go, missing you, missing you, missing you
I keep on missing, missing, missing you
When I'm going to my bed, I keep on seeing you
If you didn't love me, you should have let me know
That your love was not for real, no way
If you didn't want me, you should have let me know
Instead of scandalizing my name
You told your friends that your love steal away mine
'Cause you want to hurry on to make a date
For a big married life
You told your friends that your love steal away mine
'Cause you want to hurry on to make a date
For a big scandalize
Oh, no, no, you made me love you
You make me love you
Tell me why, tell me why?
You let me love you, you make me l-l-love you, oh, yeah
I keep on, I keep on missing you
Everywhere I go, I keep on missing you
I keep on missing, missing
Early in the morning, late in the night
I said, missing you, missing you, missing you
When I take the plane, even when I'm on the ground
My heart beat goes around, all because of you
I don't know why, I keep on missing you, keep on seeing you
Somebody told me that you say, your love is going away
But somewhere or the other, I will see you there
I keep on missing you, missing you, missing you, ah, oh
I keep on missing you, missing you, missing you, ooh, yeah
I keep on missing you, missing you

Misty mornin', don't see no sun;
I know you're out there somewhere having fun.
There is one mystery - yea-ea-eah - I just can't express:
To give your more, to receive your less.
One of my good friend said, in a reggae riddim,
"Don't jump in the water, if you can't swim."
The power of philosophy - yea-ea-eah - floats through my head
Light like a feather, heavy as lead;
Light like a feather, heavy as lead, yeah.
See no sun! Oh.
Time has come, I want you -
I want you to straighten out my tomorrow! Uh.

Oh, wo-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!
I want you to straighten out my (tomorrow)!
Misty (morning) mornin', don't see no sun;
I know you're out there somewhere having fun.
Mysteries I just can't express:
How can you ever give your more to receive your less?
Like my good friend said, in a reggae riddim:
"You can't jump - you can't jump in the water, if you can't swim."
I want you (I want you) - I want you to straighten out my today -
My tomorrow - my-my-my - my - my
(I want you to straighten out my tomorrow).
On a misty morning, uh! (I want you to straighten out my tomorrow).
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh-oh!

Straighten out my tomorrow - my tomorrow! Need some straightenin' out!
(I want you to straighten out my tomorrow)
Mist! Mm. (I want) Mist! (you to straighten out my tomorrow)
Misty! Oh! (I want you to straighten out my tomorrow) - [fadeout]

Oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord, yeah!
Well, it's not easy,
It's not easy
Speak the truth, come on, speak. Eh, now!
It ever cause it what it will:
He who hide the wrong he did
Surely did the wrong thing still.
Get in the studio of -
Studio of time and experience
Here we experience the good and bad;
What we have, and what we had -
This session (session),
Not just another version (version).
Oh Lord, give me a session (session),
Not another version (version)!
They're so much stumbling blocks right in-a our way:
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday;
There's so much wanting, so much gaining, so much have done.
Too much little mix-up, in the mix-up, yes!
Too much little mix up!
Too much of this mix up - mix up!
I was born in the country, right on top of the hill
I still remain, I know I still, I will-a,
But through your f...in' respect and through your false pride
Someone wanna take Jah - Jah - Jah children for a ride!
Shut up! Open the gate, and let the saints through.
Please make it a session (session);
Not another version (version);
Ooh, please make it a session (session);
Not another version (version)!
Hey, you been talkin' all your mouth full of lies,
Sitting there toppling and, Lord, they criticize.
So through the eyes of the fool the deaf is wise,
And through the eyes of the wise the fool is size.
Saying is too much mix up - mix up!
Saying is too much mix up - mix up!
I wanna clear the wheel once and for all;
I wanna clear my wheels, I don't care who fall!
I gotta clear my wheels once and for all;
Clear my wheels, I don't care who fall - fall:
(Too much mix-up - mix-up!)
[Guitar solo]
Hey! Mr. Music, why don't you wanna play?
Don't you know today is a bright holiday? Yeah! (holiday)
Some people waiting for the message that you bring,
They listening to every word that you'll sing.
Singing: (too much mix-up - mix-up -
(Too much little mix up!)
Would you groove along now
(Too much mix up - mix up), yeah!
Yes, would you groove along now
(Too much little mix-up!)
They just can't stop you know
(Too much mix-up - mix-up)! [fadeout]

The lord looked down from heaven on the children of man
To see if there is anyone who will understand
Do you speak of righteousness weigh the violence of your hands
Judgment will return my friends to give justice to the land
mmm mmm
The vows are upon me I've surrendered myself
And I pray that you would see not all that is sad
Awake up my glory awake my guitar
Play me songs of mercy cause the world has gone too far
mmm mmm
Why should my liberty be judged by another man
Why would I listen to the voices on the stand
By the fruits of your tree I know who you are
mmm mmm
The lord looked down from heaven on the children of man
To see if there is anyone who will understand
Do you speak of righteousness weigh the violence of your hands
Justice will return my friends to give judgment to the land
Mmm mmm

Whoa yeah
Oh... yeah
Money in my pocket, but I just can't get no love
Money in my pocket, but I just can't get no love
I'm praying for
A girl to be my own

That her love would never die
And now I'm alone, yeah, so alone
So alone, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah
Money in my pocket, but I just can't get no love, oh no
Money in my pocket, but I just can't get no love
The love I had in mind
Was very, very hard to find, oh
It's hard for a man to live without a woman, yeah
And a woman, needs a man, to cling to
You'll see what love can do
After making me feel blue
Ain't that a shame yeah, whoa... baby
Ain't that a shame, yeah

Don't tell me love makes the world go round
That is how it used to be
So many years ago yeah
These days we're living in
Everything needs a dollar
These days we're living in
Everything needs some money
You can't get no love without the dollar
You can't get no justice without the dollar
So everything is...
[Chorus:]
Money money money
Judge dread I know I've done something wrong here
And today you're here
To put me away forever
But before you bring that hammer down
Look what I have in my hand
Yeah, the wheels of justice
They turn so slow
But with this we can make them turn faster
Than a rocket in my favour
Doesn't matter what they say
I've done here today
Just look the other way
Like you always do
When you see...
[Chorus: till fade]

I had a dream last night
One that will stay with me for a long time
One that will stay with me,
For as long as I live.
We were living in a world, there was no pain
We were living in the world there were no hungry people
Everyone was at peace with one another
There was a man in my dream
He told me he's from the future,
Coming to give something better [x3]
Even though I that
[Chorus:]
One monister dies another one comes alive.
I had a dream last night
It was my dream but I know it is a dream
Of a lot of people in the world
To be living in a world, with no homeless people
To be living in a world where little children
Don't have to die, because their parents are poor
When we came to this world
We were prepared to fight a battle.
But we found a war
When we came to this world,
We were prepared to fight demons
But we found the devil himself
There was a man in my dream
He told me he's here
To gimme something better
Even though I know that,
[Chorus: till fade]
One monister dies, another one comes alive.

Do you remember Moses

Watch it now

The man 'dep on earth still
Watch it now

That man no dead...
The man a trod earth still [3x]
Watch it now
The wicked them a gwan
Remember Satan [2x]

Fulfilling his pledge to deceive the world
Remember Marcus Mosiah Garvey
Him no dead
That man no dead...
That man a trod earth still [3x]
Watching his prophecy fulfilled

Uh, uh-Huh
Hmmm.....
[Verse 1]
Babylon position the queen and set the pawn
And start transform like Deceptacon
Anytime delegates have a discrepence
Well a bare tension with some long weapons
Night vision upon the attack mission
Colaliton of folly-ticians get switch on
If you look in the face of the newly born
The newly born face malnutrition
Suspicion to what is them ambition
Total destruction start to ignition
And the world still a fight over religion
Everyone have a right to a decision
Superstition the people reflect upon, something nuh right
I man suspect a con
Cause them lost inna darkness beyond
And none shall escape except the ones, who
Exodus with no question,
Better put on your khaki uniform
If you-a' driver, leave unnu engine on
If you-a' rider jump pon a unicorn 
Lace your shoes if you a pedestrian
Run for the border like a Mexican
Underarm smell green like a Leprechaun
Survival of Jah people
[Chorus]
Exodus...movement of Jah people
[Verse 2]
Boom!
Chicken merry, Hawk is near
Tell them beware, but them still won't hear
Life is a road so you drive with care
Tire can't bust cause you got no spare
Whole-heap of lust in your atmosphere
Step pon di gas and you start draw gear
Dis Rastafari you do not dare
Some don't share and then that's not fair
Make a move, before they make a move and you
Making moves and still move and go thru
Moving things weh you not supposed to move
Watch your move and where you moving to
Who you move with, you move with you crew
Move some fool from up off the avenue
Move a pound and boost your revenue
Move uptown and overlook the view
Move around and get from one to two
Make a wrong move in the game you lose
I stand up and I refuse to move
Substance weh mi know mi nah go use
Metric measurement mi nah go choose
Moving on and you still need a clue
Car keys are the only keys wi' move
Moving on...Lord!
[Chorus Repeats]
[Verse 3]
Boom!
Music, business as usual
Mi' spliff and Guiness as usual 
Royal and muffin as usual
Highgrade we puffin as usual
Fight down the system as usual
The system fight we down as usual
The cops dem a watch we as usual
And a we a watch the cops as usual
No strap would be unusual
Roll wid it inna we lap as usual
Always ready fi clap as usual
Rastaman deh pon top as usual
Standard never drop as usual
Man-a' cream of the crop as usual
Run right 'round the clock as usual
Movement non-stop as usual
[Chorus Repeats]

The human experiment comes with pain
And through it all you got to live again
From the day that I was born
Yesterday was already gone
It's not easy so I can't pretend
Those who are angels were once my friends
I don't wanna stay with the evil I know
I don't wanna keep my enemies close
I'm moving forward,
I'm moving forward
The pain make me stronger
Can't stop me no longer
I'm moving forward,
I'm moving forward
The hurt make me stronger
Can't stop me no longer
Sometimes it seems impossible
The obstacles that we must climb
Adversity is my ally
Even though she makes me cry
Moving forward,
I'm moving forward
The pain makes me stronger
Can't stop me no longer
I'm moving forward,
I'm moving forward
The pain make me stronger
Can't stop me no longer
I'm moving forward,
I'm moving forward
The hurt make me stronger
Can't stop me no longer
The hurt makes me stronger
Can't stop me no longer
I'm moving forward,
I'm moving forward
The pain makes me stronger
Can't stop me no longer
The hurt makes me stronger
Can't stop me no longer
I'm moving forward,
I'm moving forward
The pain makes me stronger
Can't stop me no longer
The hurt makes me stronger
Can't stop me no longer

Cool down, down to the ground
Cool down your temper, Mr Cop, cool down
Hear me when I say, I say
Cool down your temper, Mr Cop, cool down
Put a smile on your face while passing through
Put away all the frown and that awful screw
We just sipping a cup and having some fun
And it's better than in the streets bashing guns
Telling me stay chilling
Cool down your temper, Mr Cop, cool down
They just licking a cup I said
Cool down your temper, Mr Cop, cool down
Say we are just sipping a cup
Meat be in market, marrow in a bone
What don't concern you, please leave it alone
Cos the grass was made for the cow and ass
And the herb on this land for the use of man
Tell 'em, Missa, tell 'em
Cool down your temper, Mr Cop, cool down
We're just licking a cup I said
Cool down your temper, Mr Cop, cool down
Say we are just sipping a cup
Cool down your temper, Mr Cop, cool down
Down down, down down
Go down, go down, go down
Coppy, stop you bothering me

My ancestors were kings of old
They ruled the world and all of its gold
But look at me, oh, look at me
Just look at me
My ancestors would find the sun
Before they bowed down to anyone
But you gonna look at me
Woh, look at me
Just look at me
Yeah, woh, look at me
I'm a stranger in this land
Watch me stand tall
Help me, help me be just a man, oh
My ancestors, they were mighty men
And my son, he will be one of them
And they'll just look at him
Yeah, they'll look at him
And they'll say, he's a man, he's a man
My son's a man, oh
My ancestors, they passed it on to me
I've got to, got to work
And pass it on to my son
And he will be a man, oh yeah
And pass it on to his son
And he will be a man, oh yes he will

Your smiling cannot fool me no more
Your sweet talking cannot fool me no more
Cause I know about your cheating
I know about you back biting
And I don't know what you know
And I have never been where you've been
And I certainly don't believe in what you believe in
And I don't do what you do
I'm a living witness, now I know that...
[Chorus:]
Not every black man is my brother
Not every white man is my enemy
Not every black man is my brother
Not every white man is my enemy
Not every black man is my brother
Not every white man is my enemy
I've got no place in your world
And I've never been where you've been
And I don't believe in what you believe in
And I certainly don't do what you do
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Oh oh ooh
I said I don't know what you know
And I haven't been where you've been
And I certainly don't believe in what you believe in
And I don't do what you do
I'm a living witness, now I know that...

Well, I feel in love with a girl on Sunday
Fell in love with my friend on Monday
My mind was worried, my heart was in trouble
He's her fascination
Her inspiration
And her destination
I was walking on a lonely road one Tuesday
I met a girl, she dates me on Wednesday
On Thursday, we were walking down the aisle
On Friday, we were feeling so fine
If it's not today, if it's not today...
She's my fascination
My inspiration
And my destination

So I see you've got a problem
Do you wanna take it outside
I'm not the fighting type
But go ahead make my day
You gonna fight me physically
I'm gonna fight you spiritually
I'm gonna fight you truthfully
If I tell the truth boy
You hate me for it
And if I tell you lies
You call me a good man
I've got news for you boy
Let me tell you this
Listen to me
[Chorus:]
This is my game
I'm gonna play it my way
You call yourself
The voice of the voiceless
But the only time you use your voice
Is when you criticise
What other people have done
We read in the Bible and
Understand what it says
They shall not judge yeah
But why do you do it Rasta
Call me a fake
Call me anything you wanna
Call me boy
But what I do is - Jah work
This is the people's work boy
You want me to say
All the things that you believe in
I'm not your puppet
I'm not your puppet listen to me
I've got news for you
[Chorus: till fade]

These are my hands, my hands are used for many things
I brush my teeth with my hands
I hug with my hands, I even paint with my hands
But what I really love to do most of all with my hands is help
I help my dad to make breakfast with my hands
I help my mom to unpack her bags when she comes
From the store, with my hands
I help to change my baby brother with my hands
I help to put away my toys with my hands
I love to do many things with my hands
But most of all I love to help with my hands, my helping hands

Every day you say
That you wish if I could go with you
Every night you keep on telling me
That you wish if I could follow you
Every time you keep on worrying, worrying me
That you wish if I could go with you
But it's a good thing I didn't follow you
Just to do those funny things you wanted me to do
Honey, you tried to, to bend my love, yeah
You made a fool of me
One time I know is not the same
When we used to play in the sun
We used to hold each other's hand
Remember we used to play in the pond
So all the good looks that you have
Would not break my heart
My old heart still remains the same
Honey, you tried to bend my love
And made a fool of me, yeah
I said my love is so strong
And my mind is unchangeable
You take a look at my face
You will see that my future's still bright
Oh, bright as the sun in the sky
Honey, you're sure to see me shine, yeah
Shine as the stars in the morning
The pattern in the sky, oh yeah
I said my love is so strong
And my mind is unchangeable
You take a good look at my face
You will see that my future is still bright
Oh, bright as the stars in the sky
Honey, you're sure to see me shine
Shine as the morning stars
That shine on the sky, yeah, yeah
Oh, that good thing have been for you
Oh, you do those funny things
Avoiding me for good
Oh, my love is so strong

I'm not yet a-sleeping
Soon the day will be dawning
Now since I broke up with you
My whole world is through
I'm so blue
You never miss your water
Until your well runs dry
You never see your tears
And then you start to cry
You break down inside you could die
My world is blue
My world is blue, ooh
Help me mama, help me papa
Can't you see I made a mistake?
I'm only living for a loving
And this heartache, I just can't take
I'm so blue
My world is blue, so blue
I need you, ooh, ooh
Come into my world, girl
Said, I need you
I gotta have you

Dinky the boy from next door
Talked to the rich man standing
In his garden, looking so
Miserable
He said you are the rich
Man here
So why do you cry
Rich man said to the boy
It's all bills and more bills
Dinky said to the rich man
I know a place where we
Can go
Where we don't pay
Government taxes
Where we don't pay
Telephone bills
All we care about is candy
Let me welcome you to the kingdom
Kingdom of the children
Little boy said
Kingdom of the children
Rich man did not believe what he heard
From the little boy
Till the little boy
Made it clear to him
[Chorus:]
In my world there's no trouble
In my world there's no worries
Let me welcome you to the
Kingdom of the children
Little ones
Rich man thought about it
Said, I have everything
But still I'm not happy
Maybe if I change
And live my life like a child
I'll be happy yeah
He said 'cause they
Don' t have no politics
They don't care about
Being rich
They don't care about
Being poor
All they care about is
CANDY

There's a natural mystic blowing through the air
If you listen carefully now you will hear
This could be the first trumpet, might as well be the last
Many more will have to suffer
Many more will have to die
Don't ask me why
Things are not the way they used to be
I won't tell no lie
One and all got to face reality now
Though I've tried to find the answer to all the questions they ask
Though I know it's impossible to go living through the past
Don't tell no lie
There's a natural mystic blowing through the air
Can't keep them down
If you listen carefully now you will hear
Such a natural mystic, blowing through the air
This could be the first trumpet, might as well be the last
Many more will have to suffer
Many more will have to die - don't ask me why
There's a natural mystic blowing through the air
I won't tell no lie
If you listen carefully now you will hear
There's a natural mystic blowing through the air
Such a natural mystic blowing through the air

Such a natural mystic blowing through the air
Such a natural mystic blowing through the air

We were only eighteen years old
Didn't know much about anything
The only thing we knew was this love
That we have for each other
You were the millionaire's daughter
I was the grave digger's son
They told me to keep away from you
They told you to stay away from me
Look at us now, we are living our dreams
Which goes to say, love is thicker than blood.
Love is thicker than blood.
Love is thicker than blood.
Take your time, take your time
Take your time don't hurry
We have all aternity ahead of us.
[Chorus:]
I will never, I will never leave you.
No matter what happenes, no matter where life
Takes us, I will never leave you.
Take your time take your time love me
Take your time, we have all eternity ahead of us.
You had a chance to be, with anyone you want
You chose to be with me.
Even though you knew, I had nothing to my name
You still love me
You were the millionaire's daughter
I was the grave digger's son,
They told me to keep away from you
They told you to stay away from me
Look at us now, we are living our dreams
Which goes to say, love is thicker than blood
Love is thicker than blood.
Take your time take your time
Take your time love me
We have all eternity ahead of us
[Chorus:]
I will never, I will never leave you, I will never,
I will never leave you
No matter what happenes, No matter where life
Takes us, I will never leave you.

I never fall in love before, but it's you my heart is aching for
Ooh, ooh, my people

That a constant friend is hard to find, find
But when you find one that is good and kind

[Chorus:]
No Nuclear War
We don't want no nuclear war
With nuclear war we won't get far
I said that We don't want no nuclear war
With nuclear war we won't get far
Said no, just another holocaust
It's just another holocaust
And we can't take no more
Too many people are hungry
They don't have food to eat
They are naked
'Cause they don't have clothes to wear
They are going insane
Because of the condition
A million babies
Are suffering from malnutrition
[Chorus]
I can't take no more
I saw World War One
Where lotsa trouble begun
I saw World War Two
When the pirates came right through
Lookin' for World War Three
But you got to set me free
Free from the chains
And this here misery
[Chorus]
We can't take no more
Unemployment
I said the rate is high
So much sick people
I'm sure they gonna die
So much mad people
Gettin' ready to explode
'Fore somebody
Come help them carry this load
[Chorus]
One country deploying MX
Another country deploying SS
Inflation goin' way up high
And the dollar is going way down low
[Chorus]
Crying, bawling, they can't take no more
I hear them moaning they can't take no more
They don't wanna die
They want to go to Heaven, yeah
But they can't
They can't take no more
They gettin' low
They can't take no more
They gettin' grief
They can't take no more
They gettin' beat
They can't take no more
They gettin' lazy
Cause they can't take no more
Bored
They can't take no more
Frustrated
They can't take no more
Pleading for them
They can't take no more
Can't you hear me pleading for them
Cause they can't take no more
They want to live in peace
And happiness
Let the trees grow
Let the waters flow...

Some peace and rest
When I'm in troubles yeah
Only me only me feel the pain
No one good word of advice
From any of my so-called friends

Might as well might as well
I get out of hell
Hell could never be made for me
So I'm gonna search search

I can't find [x3] no love at all
What kind of love [x3]

Why can't we get together and tear down the walls?

Is alive in our time; who still questions the power

Lemme talk to the people...
See I promise if you violate we coming just to lock off
The barricades of the borough, get your hand chopped off
And probably peel your top off
And pop off the ratchet right in the middle of silence
We don't advocate no violence
But if you're tryna to cross that unforgiving territory once son
And touch my family I will be abducting your loved ones
Like we in the club come, we love to hear the people shout (AHH-WOO!)
It's nothing to tear it down but I'd rather take the peaceful route
Now done with the war, we woulda love it if people screamin it out
You ain't talking about living right, then tell me what are you speaking about
Rhyming and refocused watch the look up on your face-na-na-NA!
And spread a little love, whole heap-a people inna di place-na-na-NA!
See everytime we step in the function we do it proper
It's Busta Rhymes and Barrington Levy, you better call the doctor
We keep it cool but don't forget, you don't wanna spar with us
We're very peaceful but relentless, you don't really want no war with us!

Some man dem come fi buss dem gun, shoot dem Glock
But Kardinal come fi bun bad mind, erase that talk
The time is now to recognize what's in the street, what's on the turf
My whole family, told me that I'm king of the Earth
But you earn your royalty, you can't steal or lie for it
If it ain't about my fam I ain't ready to die for it
Money's just a likkle ting, buss for your rights
Police BUSS into my mom's house in the middle of the night
Told me put my hands to the sky, beg for your life
I told em shoot if you want but leave the kids and the wife
As I looked to the floor I saw the nine within reach
But if I do what I'm thinking then who's left to teach?
My people, my community, there's no immunity
War's spreading like the plague, discouraging unity
So I pray through the skylight for Jah Jah to bless
We under stress, but intelligence and "One Love" is how we progress
Yesssss!

Then we would cook cornmeal porridge,

Yeah!
My feet is my only carriage
And so I've got to push on through.
But while I'm gone,
Everything's gonna be all right!

Nobody knows the troubles I bear
Nobody knows it, nobody knows it

Sometimes I feel like running away (oh, my Lord)

And I've seen poverty beyond compare
I know slave drivers just don't care
They just don't care
[Chorus]
Africa's the richest place
But it has the poorest race
And to me it's just a disgrace
Just a disgrace
Africans don't wait too long
We gotta fight 'cause it's not wrong
Won't you join in and sing this song
Sing this song
[Chorus]
To be poor it's a hurtful pain
Livin inna poverty it's a burning shame
Help yourself 'cause man you're not lame
You are not lame
[Chorus]

Go and tell her you're sorry
You ain't too big to apologize, no
If you care that much about her
You gotta treat my sister nice, yeah
I heard you kick her in the bum
Even though she's still your baby
But that's not the way to treat a lady
If she is wrong, try show her the right
No need to quarrel, no need to make a fight
Beca' the daughters take a little longer
To sight up the Father, yeah
I said the daughters take a little longer
To do the works of Jah Jah

Daughters take a little longer

And you can make your dreams
Make them come true
You get through everything
And cast a laugh and sing
You can do anything
That you want to, yeah

With nothing but love, sweet love
And make me smile and say it's fine

Through this evaporation, you make it alright

Can you feel it, feel it?

Notice how she moves into the night (notice)
Dressed up like a pimpers paradise (notice)
She came over to me and said
She whispered softly in my head
What do you do yea, are you alone tonight
She said, what do you do, are you a mama's child
Notice how she has an alibi (notice)
Where and when she hasn't been tonight
Seem she didn't get the drift
I had to build another spliff
What do you do yea, and are you alone tonight
She said, what do you do, are you a mama's child
...
Notice how she moves into the night (notice)
Yea, she's like a pimper's paradise
Came over to me and said

What do you do yea, are you alone tonight
She said, what do you do hey, are you a mama's child
What do you do yea, are you alone tonight
She said, what do you do dread, are you a mama's child

Now I know [x12]
You give your more receive your less
I guess some things never change
Cause here I am alone again
Though I find that rather strange
I think of things we used to do
But I guess that's only me
And all the stages we've been through
But it wasn't meant to be
And I said if I could have my dreams
At least if nothing else
And mama never raised no fool
Can feel things for myself
What used to be unbreakable
Thought this bond would never break
But nothing's permanent in life
All except for change
But 
Now I know [x12]
And I said if I could have my dreams
At least if nothing else
And mama never raised no fool
Can feel things for myself
What used to be unbreakable thought
This bond would never break
But nothing's permanent in life
All except for change
But 
Now I know [x12]

No glove, no love
You've been hearing this so many times
Don't you think it's time
To be a little more responsible
Too many people die these days, oh
If you read the papers, check out the news
The numbers are there
Every number, represents a human being
Who was a father, who was a mother
A son or a daughter of this land... oh
You don't make the commitment but your body does
Even if you're dead silent
[Chorus:]
You are here today, tomorrow you are gone
You don't wanna be another number in the book [x3]
In the shadows of the night
A lady from the street corner talks to a customer
Money exchanges hands
That's the formality and she says
No glove, no love
You can pay me well, but it ain't worth my life
Too many people die these days
If you read the papers, check out the news
The numbers are there
Every number, represents a human being
Who was a father, who was a mother
A son or a daughter of this land... oh
It ain't worth my life... oh

Please give me a chance

I said I came upon this land
To guide and teach my fellow man
But one thing I can't overstand
Is why them don't love his brother man
[Chorus]
Sometimes I sit and look around
And listen to the daily sound
But when I check, there's so much lies
And that's the reason why the children cry
[Chorus]
It's been so long, we need a change
So the shitstem we got to rearrange
And if there's obstacles in the road,
We got to throw them overboard

One night, an evil spirit held me down
I could not make one single sound
Jah told me, 'Son, use the word'
And now I'm as free as a bird

Oh my son, I am sorry about what happened
Many years ago
Me and your mother had trouble all the time
We could not stay together any more
The last solution was getting divorced
I know what that means to your life
I can hear you crying
From a million miles away
Calling "Daddy" but there's no answer
But deep down in me I know the reason why
'Cause the blood that runs in you
Is the same as the blood in me
I mean the blood, the blood that runs in you
Is the same as the blood in me
Oh my son I'm sorry
Oh my son I'm sorry
Oh my son I'm sorry
I can hear you crying
From a million miles away
Calling "Daddy" but there's no answer
But deep down in me I know the reason why
'Cause the blood that runs in you
Is the same as the blood in me
I mean the blood, the blood that runs in you
Is the same as the blood in me
'Cause the blood that runs in you
Is the same as the blood in me
I say the blood, the blood that runs in you

And I've got to find some way to make it
Music is what I've got, baby

Shake it, shake it, baby

You wanna see my face?
Look in my pains.
Look in my pains.
Look in my pains.
You see them pains from yesterday?
Look in my pains.
And this morning feels so close to the past
For just yesterday we were left in the dark
And the oppression of those chains still weighs on your and my brain
Can you see what I'm saying?
Look in my pains.
You see them pains from yesterday?
Look in my pains.
Was I born free?
Was I born a slave?
Look in my pains.
Wanna see my pains?
Look at my face.
With the whip upon your mind so your mind leads your soul astray.
You can see that today we are all modern slaves.
We've been thinking that slavery is just from them ancient days,
But that's the puppet master's game! can you see what I'm saying?
Look in my pains.
You see them pains from yesterday?
Look in my pains.
Look in my pains.
How far have we gone from yesterday?
Look in my pains.
Look in my pains.
And this morning feels so close close to the past
For still yet today we are slaves in our yards
Because oppression of those chains still weighs on my and your brain
Should I gonna sing it again?
Look in my pains.
You see them pains from yesterday?
Look in my pains.
Was I born free?
Are we all slaves?
Look in my pains.
How far have we gone from yesterday?
Look in my pains.

We gon' do our best
Never let it rest
Till our good be better
And our better best
Said I don't drink coffee
For they say 
It's just not right for me
But what makes me irie
Is if I could get a little piece of tree
And build
One good spliff
Me and my little brothers
We take a ride
Gonna teach them
All the lessons that I have learned in life
One good spliff
Me and my younger brothers
We take a ride
I've gotta teach them
All the lessons that I have learned in life
Sometimes I feel the pressure
But I know that I'll be fine
Just as long as you got me 
Something for my mind
Now let me get a rizzla
Little bit a herb
Light a old match
Let me settle my nerves
I gotta feel real high
Just to touch up on these tracks
Several ounces a day as a matter of fact
Now in Jamaica
Where the air is clean
And the buds all glisten with the glowing green 
Guaranteed to lift you up
If you know what I mean
Read me loud and clear
Let me hear you scream
Now, you haven't been there
You should go there soon
And pass through the country
Get a touch of the boom
Go back to your shack or your hotel room
Call Mom and Pop says 
I'll be home soon
Hanging with the Marleys all afternoon
And I ain't coming home till next May or June
Keep giving me the good vibration
It's giving me that inspiration
And I love that good sensation
Matter of fact
I think I might build myself one
One good spliff
Me and my younger sisters
We take a ride
One good spliff
Start the day out right
One good spliff
I didn't get no sleep last night
And I've got to get
One good spliff
I'm picking up 
Good vibrations
One good spliff

Jah gave Moses 10 commandments upon two tables of stone,
Led Israel out of Egypt an den promise them a home,
Samson slew the Philisteens wid a donkey jaw bone,
An david slew goliath wid a two two wey crome,
Blessed be da man wey walketh not inna de war zone,
Blessed be di man wey hair natty nappy an grown, blessed be di herbs

[From Charlie Chaplin's famous Barber speech in the Great Dictator]
I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor, that's not my business
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone
I should like to help everyone, if possible, Jew, Gentile, black man, white
We all want to help one another, human beings are like that
We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery
We don't want to hate and despise one another
In this world there is room for everyone
And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone
The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way
Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate
Has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed
We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in
Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want
Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness, hard and unkind
We think too much and feel too little
More than machinery we need humanity
More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness
Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost
The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together
The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men
Cries out for universal brotherhood, for the unity of us all
Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world
Millions of despairing men, women and little children
Victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people
To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair
The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed
The bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress..
The hate of men will pass and dictators die
And the power they took from the people, will return to the people
And so long as men die liberty will never perish
Soldiers, don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you and enslave you
Who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel
Who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder
Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men
Machine men, with machine minds and machine hearts
You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men
You have the love of humanity in your hearts
You don't hate, only the unloved hate, the unloved and the unnatural
Soldiers, don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty.
In the seventeenth chapter of Saint Luke it is written
"The kingdom of God is within man", not one man, nor a group of men
But in all men, in you, the people, you the people have the power
The power to create machines, the power to create happiness
You the people have the power to make life free and beautiful
To make this life a wonderful adventure.
Let us use that power, let us all unite
Let us fight for a new world, a decent world
That will give men a chance to work
That will give you the future and old age and security
By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power
But they lie, they do not fulfil their promise, they never will
Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people
Now let us fight to fulfil that promise, let us fight to free the world
To do away with national barriers, do away with greed, with hate and intolerance
Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.
Soldiers, let us all unite!

Pain in my heart
She's treating me cold
Where can my baby be?
Lord, no one knows
Pain in my heart
Just won't let me sleep
Where can my baby be?
Lord, where can she be?
Another day, as again it is though
I want you to come back, come back
Come back, baby, 'til I get enough
A little pain in my heart
Just won't let me be
Wake up at restless nights
Lord and I can't even sleep
Stop this little pain in my heart
Another day as again it's rough
I want you to love me, love me, love me
Baby, 'til I get enough
Pain in my heart, a little pain in my heart
Stop this little pain in my heart
Stop this little pain in my heart
Someone stop this pain
Someone stop this pain

This song is for all the children
This song is for all the children
You can't enter Mount Zion
Jah said if you ain't like a child
You can't enter Mount Zion
Mount Zion, Mount Zion, Mount Zion
Mama want you to be what she wants you to be
You got to be what you got to be
Yes everyone suffers from the pains of life
And everyone suffers from the pains of life
Pains of life, pains of life, the pains of life
Everyone suffers from the pains of life
Everyone suffers from the pains of life
Pains of life, pains of life, the pains of life
This song is for all the children
This song is for all the children
Jah said if you ain't like a child
You can't enter Mount Zion
Jah said if you ain't like a child
You can't enter Mount Zion
Oh Mount Zion, Mount Zion, Mount Zion

How many times I told you I love you?
And now you wanna say that we are through
What more can I do?
What more can I say to you? Now you're gone
Do you remember that first night we met?
That was a moment I never will forget
Love was at first sight, and you came walking 
through the pale- pale moonlight
P-p-pale, p-p-pale, Pale moonlight
Do-do-do-wapchoo-wapchoo wap do [x3]
Stoodildoodlewapchoo - wapchoo wap do
How many times I told you I love you
But now you want say that we are through
What more can I do?
What more can I say to you? Now you're gone
Do you remember that first night we met?
That was a moment I never will forget
Love was at first sight, and you came walking 
through the pale- pale moonlight
P-p-pale, p-p-pale, Pale moonlight
Do-do-do-wapchoo-wapchoo wap do [x3]
Stoodildoodlewapchoo - wapchoo wap do
How many times I told you I love you
But now you want say that we are through
What more can I do?
What more can I say to you?

[CHORUS (Jimmy Cozier)]
When love, takes me over
Its paradise
When love, takes me over
It's always nice
[VERSE]
Touch pon di ends
And a incense, herbs and oils
Scrapbook newspaper
Clippings and files
A view of di countryside
Remind me of nine miles
Where di trees are green
And di people smile
After few water crackers
And some warm milo tea
Rub massage home made 
Coco butter skin cream 
Interior design of
Ights gold and green
And the vibes are pure
And the thoughts are clean
She collect her own
Dividends weekly
So mi know ah no money
Mek she seek me
Cool me down 
And tie mi knotty dem neatly
Draw close 
While whispering sweetly
Mi teach her each and everytime
That she link me
We haffi bun
A five bills bag a stinky
True she roots and culture
She win me
I even had to
Introduce her to Cindy
[CHORUS]
[VERSE (Mr. Cheeks)]
[VERSE]
Well I was sitting 
By an open fire place
In my flavorite dungarees
I play a few strums
Upon my guitar
And It sounds so good to me
Big skunky blunt a blaze
And plus
My flavorite stooks beside me
I glance over 
Just so I could see her
But my locks got in the way
Cool breeze a blow
Thru the weeping willow
She always leave
A fragrance on my pillow
When I'm ready 
She will always follow
Me to the place of
My old sleepy hollow
Soft silky voice is
So sacred and hollow
Cause out spoken noisy
Streams run shallow
Reach to the stars
When I launch the Apollo
Could a land up ah Sao Paulo
[CHORUS]

I love to see you smile
More than you like
I see it in your eyes
This is paradise
I love it when you smile
Stay with me awhile
This is paradise
This is paradise
She shows me that she loves me
And i'll never leave her
Cause everytime i'm with her is like my favorite song
And my heart goes jumping bum bum bum bum bum bum
And she best believe me she can't do nothing wrong
Shows me that she loves me
And i'll never leave her
Cause everytime i'm with her is like my favorite song
And my heart goes jumping bum bum bum bum bum bum
And she best believe me
I love to see you smile
More than you like
I see it in your eyes
This is paradise
I love it when you smile
Stay with me awhile
This is paradise
This is paradise
This is paradise
This is paradise
Paradise is a feeling of euphoria so glorious and intimate it's soothing to your body
Paradise is when you roll one up in the Maserati while you're listening to the music of a Marley
The wind on your face while you're on a Harley
On the road looking at unfamiliar faces
Gotta be a thuse if you want a caribbean cruise only you can take to an oasis
Turn up
And do you think I want to be with somebody hot no
And when i'm rubbing on her body do you think she gone be telling me to stop no
So lil mama you got a part and breath and it's like i'm in the garden of eden
Surrounded by ice
Paradise yes
I love to see you smile
More than you like
I see it in your eyes
This is paradise
I love it when you smile
Stay with me awhile
This is paradise
This is paradise
I love you love of flow
My body like glow
You had me at hello
This is paradise
This is paradise

What your hands do,
It's your own eyes that've seen.
So won't you judge your actions
To make sure the results are clean?
It's your own conscience
That is gonna remind you
That it's your heart and nobody else's
That is gonna judge.
Be not selfish in your doings:
Pass it on. (Pass it on, children)
Help your brothers (help them) in their needs:
Pass it on.
Live for yourself and you will live in vain;
Live for others, you will live again.
In the kingdom of Jah,
Man shall reign.
Pass it on;
Pass it on;
Pass it on;
Pass it on.
What's in the darkness
Must be revealed to light.
We're not here to judge what's good from bad
But to do the things that are right.
On a hot, sunny day,
Follow the shadows for rescue.
But as the day grows old,
I know the sun is gonna find you.
Be not selfish in your doings:
Pass it on.
Help your brothers in their needs:
Pass it on.
Live for yourself, you will live in vain;
Live for others, you will live again.
In the kingdom of Jah,
Man shall reign.
Pass it on;
Pass it on;
Pass it on;
Pass it on. (Pass it on)

Wanna feel your touch, wanna hear your sound
Every time I see, see your face
You paint the perfect picture
Every time I'm with you
Oh, you and I, a world apart
Please, let me know, if I have your heart
'Cause every time I'm with you
You paint the perfect picture
This relationship, society can't relate
They say we're two opposite
They say it's all a mistake
They say I'm no good for you
They say you're too good for me
Dem said our puzzle don't fit
Well, baby I disagree
Your mama told you to be
A very good behaving
And now just because of me
They say you're misbehaving
Dad is not talking to you
Because he doesn't approve
No lies no truth, no truth no lie
Oh, Jah is here, so I must obey
Oh, you and I, a world apart
But every time I'm with you
We paint the perfect picture
Please, let me know, if I have your heart
We'll share the pains, oh, we'll share the joy
'Cause every time I'm with you
We paint the perfect picture
She said they taught her to love
And now they want her to hate
They said they're kicking her out
She told them she'll be okay
As long as she's loving me
She told them she'll be alright
She's so ready to live
She's excited for life
Is she reckless at heart?
'Cause she won't leave me alone
She's always in my thoughts
I got her face on my phone
Picture's as perfect can be
Every time she's with me
It's time for us to get closer now
Wanna feel your touch, wanna hear your sound

Please, let me know, if I have your heart
You paint the perfect picture
Every time I'm with you
Well, baby it's you and me
We're painting portraits of love
Why won't they let us be free
And just let God be the judge
They've never been so ashamed
We've never been so in love
I'd rather hold on to you
They'd rather hold on to grudge
It's always been me and them
It's always been you and I
They taught us live and let live
They'd rather live and let die
I pray they live to forgive
And I say, "Baby, don't cry"
'Cause when it's all said and done
And man a shed flesh and bone
They won't care who was wrong
They would wish you were home
It's reminding me of, a little story I know
It's like Ali and Marley
Or maybe Leah alone
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, I adore you
You're pretty like a picture with love
You're my Mona Lisa

You paint the perfect picture with love

Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, I adore you
You paint a perfect picture with love

Sittin' in the morning sun
And watching all the birds passing by
Oh how sweet they sing
And oh how much I wish that I could fly
And I try
I said I try
I try
I really try try try
But I got to
Pick myself up
Dust myself off
Start all over, again (Chorus 2x)
Sittin' in the midday sun
And wondering where my meal's coming from
After working so hard
Not even piece of bread at the yard
And I said I try
Oh Lord I try
I try
I really try try try
Sittin' in the evening sun
And watching the same birds passing by
Sittin' and wondering
And waiting for the time for me to fly
And I try
I said I try
Good Lord I try
I really try try try
So long and I just find
It was just a waste of time
So long and I just find
I been been wasting all my time
I've got to pick myself up...

[Black Thought Speaking]
And yes y'all, you now rocking with the best
Black Thought from the legendary Roots crew in the flesh
I split up in here with the brothers from the Marley family
Creston--we gon' say it for y'all
[Stephen Marley]
She loves to party, have a good time
She looks so hearty, feeling fine
She loves to smoke, sometimes shifting coke
Hey...she'd be laughing when there ain't no joke
[Chorus: Stephen Marley]
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was now
Pimpa's paradise! that's all she was
[Verse 1]
Cause coke was a thing that once she first try
Was once a blue moon to once a blue sky
Now she's wondering who else wants to go buy
She don't got no money and wants to get high
Story sounds familiar,
Like born to be wild but she sillier
Not quite the same, but she similar
A waste of my sarsaparilla
Used to look good in the videos, now she look hideous
Now it's broken crack pipes with lipstick traces
Walks the cold nights red district places
She seen more hotels than my tour suitcases
More male customers than Old Navy's 
She love lime light more than John Swaby's
Seen more miles than a Rent-A-Avis
She don't slow down then someday maybe
She lost and can't find her way to safety
[Chorus Repeats]
[Black Thought]
Check it out
She keep her head up in the space like a satellite
Because she got an insatiable appetite
For staying out late nights with all the parasites
Plotting on a way to cop a little piece of paradise
Her dignity the only thing that she could sacrifice
Just get the monkey off her back and she'd be back in line
Five minutes she stay on the move, 
She'd done smoked up the stone that the builder refused
All coked up alone, she ain't even in tune
And it's sad cause she ain't really have a reason to use
She was pretty girl
Cleaner than the Board of Health
Studied and enjoyed herself, I don't know what drove her to avoid herself
Destroyed herself and took a taste of the yay'
And now she on the track, working while she wasting away
It's safe to say, she looking for a someplace to stay
Who ever got a little paper to play
Can get a slice of this...
[Chorus Repeats]
[Verse 2]
For no reason a seasoned splif was the first thing
One spring season while she's out flirting
Now she season in and don't need rehearsing
Esteem get a beating, life is uncertain
Ego need feeding, now the wants worsen
Beneath the demons she's a warm person
When she's not fiending, swearing and cursing
Behind the curtains, she's really hurting
And while her people don't even trust her at home
The dealer dem grin and cook the rocks down
And she without sin will spark the first stone
The feeling kicks in she's in the dark zone
Old friends walk pass going 'bout their own
As if she is someone that they don't know
Then the King of Kings lift her off the floor
Saying, "Life is a thing when you learn you grow."
[Chorus Repeats]
[Verse 3]
She rise and she fall like a star
Her life write off like a car
Her face full of all kinda scar
Always quick fi start a war 
She can't keep herself up to par
She plays like a broken guitar
She always want tek it too far
I doubt she a-go mek it too far
She rise and she fall like a star
Her life write off like a car
Her face full of all kinda scar
Always quick fi start a war 
She can't keep herself up to par
She plays like a broken guitar
She always want tek it too far
Mi wonder how she mek it so far

She love to party, have a good time;
She looks so hearty, feeling fine;
She loves to smoke, sometime shiftin' coke;
She'll be laughin' when there ain't no joke.
A pimper's paradise: that's all she was now;
A pimper's paradise: that's all she was;
A pimper's paradise: that's all she was now;
Pimper's paradise: that's all she was.
(Every need got an ego to feed;
Every need got an ego to feed.)
She loves to model up in the latest fashion (oo-bee doo-be doo);
She's in the scramble and she moves with passion (oo-bee doo-be doo),
She's getting high, trying to fly the sky (oo-bee doo-be doo)!
Eh! Now she is bluesing when there ain't no blues.
Wo-o-o-oh! A pimper's paradise: that's all she was now;
A pimper's paradise: that's all she was, oh-ho-ho-ho-ho!
A pimper's paradise: that's all she was now;
A pimper's paradise: that's all she was.
(Every need got an ego to feed;

Wo-ho-o-oh! A pimper's paradise: that's all she was now, wo-oo-o-oo! Wo-oh!
A pimper's paradise: that's all she was. We-e-e-ell-a!
A pimper's paradise: I'm sorry for the victim now;
Oh, now soon their (pimper's paradise) - soon their heads - soon their -
Soon their very heads will bow.
(Pimper's paradise) Don't lose track - don't lose track of yourself, oh no!
(Pimper's paradise) Don't be just a stock - a stock on the shelf -
stock on the shelf, oh-oh!
(Pimper's paradise) that's all she was now. Wo-oo-o-oo-o-oo ...

Things was lovely when she was loving me
We at the club together sippin on bubbly
Trust me I'm waking up and now she not around

Almost kinda strange how everything about you too right
Hold me like you love me baby girl you squeeze it too tight
So win the girl a waiter flag
And I'm pleased to say I'm so passionate about the thing we have
So I'm coming to get you

She tell me say me loving sweeter than chocolate
Special ringtone to me phone anytime she call it
Sing me clutch press the gas don't ever stall it

No no
No shot

Well but it is only began
Behind everyone's back
No fools get shot
In a Kingston

In Chicago
Way down, way down in a Kingston
Down in South Africa

And in Ethiopia
Military power turn them fools
We got to stop
This brutality

Watch them

You gave the guns
Just to shoot a brother man
But, but when it was over
You put them in a slam
You only had one thing on your mind
That was to win the elections
Now now now that you've won
I said you said you can do whatever you want
But still
Down in South Africa
Is them rule
And in Ethiopia
Them thought fools
We, we got to we got to
We got to stop
This brutality
Police brutality...
You got to stop

Trigger trigger happy
Shootin' the baby
Shootin' the children
Police police brutality
Trigger trigger happy

How do you feel when you lie?
Straight faced while people cry
How do you feel when you promise something
That you know you'll never do
Giving false hope to the people
Giving false hope to the underpriviledged
Do you really sleep at night?
When you know you're living a lie
To you it is just a job
To the people it hurts to the bone
[Chorus:]
Ooh political games that they play [x4]
What do you say to the orphans?
Of the women and men you sent to war
What do you say to the widows?
Of the men you sent to war
Telling them it is good for the country
When you know it's good for your ego
What a shame.
Do you really sleep at night?
When you know you're living a lie
You talking tough, you talking sincerely
Giving false hope to the infected
Giving false hope to the affected.
To you it is just a job
To the people it hurts to the bone.
[Chorus:]
Ooh political games that they play
[Till fade]

A rich man's heaven is a poor man's hell
So many years I've been slaving in your factory
Never had a chance to talk with the boss
And for so long I've been living in this old community
Where no one knew my pain yet I've paid the cost
No one knew my pain lord yet I've paid the cost
But I would rather to live poor and clean
Than to live rich in corruption
I said that I've I've got to live clean
Cause Jah has got to pass down judgement
Said I wanna be clean
Can't you see what I mean?
Wanna be strong
All day long
I would rather to live poor and clean
Than to live rich in corruption
I wanna be clean
Can't you see what I mean?
A rich man's heaven is a poor man's hell

Now Natty wasn't in a position

So she said she can't afford to put her eggs
Not at all in one basket
Then she started running up and down
Giving her love all over town
Until Natty start to step it one a way
Because she said she couldn't stay
'Cause he didn't have a car in his possession
To take to the party
And the clothes that he was wearing
Was torn and tampered, but still he was hearty
But what a rude little girl like that

Poor slave
Take the shackles off your body
Poor slave
Put the shackles on your mind
Please listen to me carefully
And if I'm wrong, then correct me
But if I'm right, mind not the praise
Now let us see if we agree
The definition of a slave
Means once a tree, entirely
So a slave is still a slave
If he can think independently
Poor slave
Take the chains off your body
Poor slave
Put the chains on your mind
A tree is still a tree
Though it shed its leaves when winter falls
But it blooms again in spring
Because it did not lose its roots at all
But a slave
Remains a slave
Without the knowledge of its roots
Until, he thought his past
Not just some, but all the truths
Poor slave
Take the chains off your body
Poor slave
Put the chains on your mind
There was a brother the other day
Telling me he's feeling high
Well I just sadly had to sigh
'Cause drugs and booze are lorey
And if I'm asked how to get high
I'll tell them truths and not a lie
The highest high that man can get
Is with knowledge and understanding
Poor slave
Ease the pressure off your body?
Poor slave
Put the pressure on your mind
Poor slave
Ever take the pressure off your body?
Poor slave
Put the pressure on your mind
Poor slave
Take the shackles off your body
Poor slave
Put the shackles on your mind

But four grey walls staring at me
The policeman said to me, son
They won't build no schools anymore
All they'll build will be prison, prison [x3]
'Cause today, yeah
[Chorus:]
I am a prisoner [x3]
Dear lord
I asked the policeman and said
How much must I pay for my freedom?
He said to me, son
They won't build no schools anymore
They won't build no hospitals [x2]
All they'll build will be prison, prison [x4]

We've been waiting for so long For this freedom,
When other freedom fighters

Marching soldier
Fought of the rights of the people,
You fought for the right to
Abuse people
That is why I call you...
[Chorus:]
Puppet master
Marching soldier
I was a little boy
When it happened
But I can still hear
Those killing machines
Roaring like thunder
Roaring like hungry lions
And they don't only hurt us
Physically
And they don't only hurt us
Politically
But they hurt us mentally.

A nuff a seh dem hot an a boast

She stood outside
In the middle of the night
Looking so far away
As far as she could see
Where the sky meets the land
Looking for answers
Her life is falling apart
Her marriage is on the rocks
She thinks about her mother
She thinks about her children
She thinks about the church
And everybody that thought
They had it made in heaven
Suddenly the comfort
In the house don't mean nothing
All she needs is some loving
In her life
Oh God
[Chorus:]
Put a little love
In my world
In her mind
The dream is still alive
But if you ask me
I can't tell you right now
It's a losing battle
Her mother told her
About this time
The vows she took
Were a mere formality
But in her life
They became a reality
And by the look of things
She's fighting a losing battle
Joleen is about to take her man
Why do bad things happen
To good people?
She thinks about her mother
She thinks about her children
She thinks about the church
Suddenly the money in the house
Don't mean nothing
All she needs is love
[Chorus: till fade]

Feel them spirit
Feel them spirit
Feel them spirit

No man no frowns when a man a mek food
Kings at the road, yes a dem a get rude

In everyman's life where he's got to face
The truth no matter what
We are coming to you father
With our sins and everything
To thank you

They wanna thank you lord
Even though police cut it down
Sometimes they burn it down
But it grows again
Thank you father

We wanna thank you father
For everything you've given us ...
Nations that oppress other nations
Wanna thank you father
Even though it's painful to be oppressed
But they thank you...
For making them strong
Politicians wanna thank you father
For making them to be able
To lie with a straight face
While the nation cries
They wanna thank you lord

Nation war against nation.
Where did it all begin?
When will it end?
Well, it seems like: total destruction the only solution,
And there ain't no use: no one can stop them now.
Ain't no use: nobody can stop them now.
Give them an inch, they take a yard;
Give them a yard, they take a mile (ooh);
Once a man and twice a child
And everything is just for a while.
It seems like: total destruction the only solution,
And there ain't no use: no one can stop them now.
There ain't no use: no one can stop them now;
Ain't no use: no one can stop them now;
There ain't no use: no one can stop them now.

We hear you crying

Trying to get people to help you ye ye
But nobody will
Your son was brutalizing people everytime.
But you said nothing
Now it's the time to pay the price
It's time to pay ye ye ye ye
[Chorus:]
You gonna reap just what you sow [x4]
Coming back home
With stolen things
Instead of telling him
How wrong he was
You told him how clever he was
People coming out of burning houses
It's your son Driving stolen cars every time
It's your son,
But you said nothing
But now he's turning against you
[Chorus:]
You gonna reap just what you sow [x3]
Everybody knows
No jail can keep him
'Cause you rubbing shoulders with the law
But now it's time to pay the price wo... woh

You gonna reap just what you sow

If you don't see me smiling
It got nothing to do with you
My papa been on the rock so long
Inherited a permanent screw...
If you don't see me smiling
It ain't no concern of you
My mama been on the rock for so long
Inherited a permanent screw...
So you won't even know me
'Cause you can't look me in the eye
Well only then my friend you would see
That I am a rebel in disguise
Said I am a rebel in disguise
And I am a rebel in disguise
We are rebels in disguise

If you don't catch me smiling
Said I have got serious on my mind
Want to tell you a little story
We are living in a serious time...
Said a fire deh, said a fire deh
Fire deh a mus mus tall
You think a cool breeze
Life is real hard
But you think it gonna ease
By letting the pressure pile up on me
The baby crying
You come and ask us for a dollar bill
And we give you ten
Simply mean you should not be coming back again
Simply mean you go home and learn to help yourself
You are putting, you are putting on the pressure
Making it, making it much harder
If you don't see me smiling
It ain't got nothing to do with you
...
Then again you might have done something wrong
And you don't know where you belong
...
So you won't really know us
We are rebels in disguise
Said I am a rebel in disguise
Said I am a rebel in disguise
And we are rebels in disguise
And we are rebels in disguise
Fire de a mus mus tail
And you think a cool breeze
Your life is real hard but you think it's gonna ease
By letting the pressure pile up on me

If the rebel in me
Can touch the rebel in you
And the rebel in you
Can touch the rebel in me
And the rebels we be
Is gonna set us free
Then it would bring out the rebel

Rebellion rises
Rebellion rises
Everywhere I go
Rebellion rises
Walks of life, let's stand together
Dance all night with each other
Love is its weakness
The system I protest
And we are its biggest threat
The plague of consciousness
Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Everywhere I go (everywhere we go)
Rebellion rises
Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Everywhere I go (everywhere we go)

Jah call up on all people
To reject the principles of hate
And rebel against those doctrines
And the violence that they create
They say time changes everything
But we change times
Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Rebellion rises (the level is rising)
Everywhere I go (everywhere we go)
Rebellion rises (everywhere we go)
Rebellion rises (the level is rising)

This is the age of awareness
Oh sooth my soul it's so restless
Turning the page to see what's next
And find us a way to pass this test
So I would a never treat you cruel
We just can't keep living by those rules
So come on people, don't be fooled
Walks of life, let's jam together
Dance all night with each other
Love is its weakness
The system we protest
And we are its biggest threat
The wave of consciousness
Rebellion rises (the level is rising)

When I look
When I look
When I look
Oh yes indeed
When I look
I could see the earth before me
I could see them wave their hands to me
All I got to do is shake my head and cry
'Cause when I look and see no one's been cheering me
When I start forgetting about the world and my life
Somebody said it's the wrong thing to do
So I stop forgetting about the world and my life
Then I heard a voice from heaven saying "Toots, don't fret no more"
So I stopped, looked, and listened
Oh then I hear the good kind say
Son you can go your way
Yes you just buck up and free again
Yes I'm free again
I'm glad to see you free again
Good lord I'm free again
I'm glad to see you free again
It's so free, it's so nice
I'm glad to see you free again
It's so wonderful and so marvelous just to see me free again
I'm glad to see myself free again

[Chorus:]
I'm recruiting soldiers
For Jah army
Recruiting soldiers
Jah time is now
Satan forces
They all rise up to fight
They all rise up to fight Jah and the saints
See them fighting
Against Jah children
See them slaughter them light slaves
Hear them come say Jah is dead
But they didn't show me his grave
No, no
[Chorus]
Anti-Christ forces
They all rise up
To fight against Jah and his saints
I can tell you
But there is confusion
In high places
About the lamb that was slain
And all these years I hear them say
Their building a nation
But all these tricks were just a game
[Chorus]
Lightning forces
Jah time is now
Lucifer forces
They all they all rise up
To fight against Jah and his saints
But that won't work
Hear them praising old Marcus Garvey
Hear them exalting his name
But all these times they be doing that I say
If he was here right now he'd go to jail the same
[Chorus]
Only to fight... fighting a losing battle
But they fight

I, I've been left waiting
You just keep on going
I got to pray with all my heart
While I sing redemption songs
I got to pray with all my heart
While I sing redemption songs

He said, it's just the word
That God speakest from my mouth
That hurts your heart
It's just the word

That hurts your heart

Old pirates, yes, they rob I
Sold I to the merchant ships
Minutes after they took I
From the bottomless pit
But my hand was made strong
By the hand of the Almighty
We forward in this generation
Triumphantly
Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom?
'Cause all I ever have
Redemption songs

None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
'Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look? Ooh!

Woke up this morning
With a funny funny feelin'
And that feelin'
Was an unusual feelin'
Inna my bone yeah
It inna my blood
Inna my toes
Coming up to my brain
Went to the doctor
To check out what's matter
I Went to the doctor
To find out the matter
Doctor said son
You have a Reggaemylitis
I said, "What"
Doctor said son
You have a Reggaemylitis
Is it contagious
Is it outrageous
Is it vicious
Or is it dangerous
Inna mi bones
Inna me blood
From my toes
Up to my brain
I can feel it inna my bones
Inna my ankle
From my toes
Up to my brain
Is it incurable
It's fit for desirable
It isn't curable
Fit for desirable
I have it inna my toes
Inna my ankles
Inna my knees
Up to my waist
Under mi ribs
Across mi shoulder
Inna mi finger
Up to my brain
Reggaemylitis I say...
You only catch it one way
It's Reggaemylitis I say
Sometimes your temperature
It really gets higher
And the music
Sets your soul on fire
Got it inna my toes
Inna my knees
Inna my ankles
Inna my waist
Inna my heart
Inna my soul
Inna my mind
Come through my mouth
Inna my finger
Registered in my brain

You don't have to come with me
Down this road
'Cause I know my way around here
Very well
It may not seem like it
From where you stand
But believe you me, I know what
I'm talking about
Letting it all go
Didn't matter to me
'Cause I've done it all before
But when you left
Part of me left with you
That is why I call you now
On this phone
So please, oh please
Don't hang up on me
[Chorus:]
Release me let me go [x3]
But remember that
Some bridges never burn
You took your way
And I took mine
We were sure our ways
Will never meet again
Everytime I go out
With another man
I find myself calling your name
Now I know that it's true
What they say
Sometimes love
Never knows when to die
When you went
Part of me went with you
That's why I called you on the phone
[Chorus:]
Release me let me go
Remember that
Some bridges never burn
Oh-ho-oh-ho... ho
Oh-ho-oh-ho... ho

Daddy where ever you are remember me
In what ever you do I love you
Daddy where ever you are remember me
In what ever you do I love you
You left for the city many years ago
Promised to come back
And take care of us
Many years have gone by now
Still no sign of you Daddy
Mother died of a heart attack
Many years ago when she heard
That you were married again
Now, I'm the only one left
In the family
[Chorus]
Wandering up and down
The streets of Soweto
No place to call my home
I tried to find you
Many years ago
But the women you' re married to
Was no good at all
[Chorus]
Daddy yo!
[Chorus: till fade]

When you flash that badge
You want everyone to shiver
When you flash that badge
You want everyone to worship you
I got no time to worship human kind
I only worship the All Mighty
Through his prophets I have learned
To give respect to everything he created
I give love to those who gimme love
Love those who gimme war.
I love those who hate me
I bless even those who curse me yeah [x2]
[Chorus:]
Gimme gimme respect
Show me show me show me respect.
You could be the president
You could be his deputy
You don't even have to know
My political affiliation
You don't even have to know
My religious affiliation
Respect me, for who I am
And not what I am
Nobody even cares about your dollars
Nobody even cares about your bling bling
Give love to those who give you love
Love to those who give you war.
Love those who hate you
Bless even those who curse you, yeah [x2]
[Chorus:]
Gimme Gimme respect
Show me show me respect

A little peace of mind all the time

And I know there is room for everyone to stay
I know there will be a way for me and you
I want to live in unity
Let us live in unity

Almost everyone is living in fear
If you look over yonder there
You will see that love don't have no fear

And no matter what game they play,
Eh, we got something they could never take away;

Kings of kings, lords of lords
Conquering lion of the tribe of judah
Elect of god, mighty god
Everliving god, earth's rightul ruler
Blessed be the man that walk'eth not
In the counsel of the ungodly
Nor stand'eth in the ways of sinners
Nor sitt'eth in the seat of the scornful
For I delight is in the law of the lord god, Selassie I
In his laws do I meditate day and night
Therefore I must be like a tree
Planted by the rivers of water
And bring'eth forth fruit in due season
I locks also shall not wither
And whatsoever I do'eth shall prosper
The weak heart are not so, oh no!
They are like the chaff that the wind driv'eth away
Therefore no weak heart shall stand in the judgment
Nor no sinners in the congregation of the righteous
For the lord god so high
That he know'eth the way of the righteous
And know that the way of the weak heart
Shall crumble, paralyze and burn

But he delight in earthquake, brimstone and fiyah
To kill, crum
Jah! mighty god! everliving god!
And do away with all weak heart
Conception to my creation continually
And let our righteousness cover this earth

They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain:
For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord,
As the waters cover the sea.
He reigns from that iwa until this iwa
Hailful I, so high and so mighty

I am the earth rightful ruler

Where he sat down
And there he wept
When he remembered Zion
'Cause the wicked carried us away in captivity
Required from us a song
How can we sing King Alpha's song
In a strange land?
'Cause the wicked carried us away in captivity
Required from us a song
How can we sing King Alpha's song
In a strange land?

Yeah Man...
Jah will be waiting there, We a shout!
Jah will be waiting there
[Verse 1]
In this world of calamity
Dirty looks and grudges and jealousy
And police weh abuse dem authority
Media clowns weh nuh know 'bout variety
Boom!
The youngest veteran a go murder dem slow
Ragga muffin sent to call me from the bush bungalow
Unnu watch mek I clear out my voice now Figaro!
Emerge from the darkness with mi big blunt a glow
Mi hammer dem a slam and spectator get low
Some bwoy coulda big like Bam Bam Biggalow
Bust of trigger finger, trigger hand and trigger toe
A two gun mi have mi bust dem inna stereo 
Cause
[Hook]
I got to keep on walking on the road to Zion, man
We gots to keeps it burning on the road to Zion, man
[Chorus 1]
Clean and pure meditation without a doubt
Don't mek dem take you like who dem took out
Jah will be waiting there we a shout
Jah will be waiting there!
In this world of calamity
Dirty looks and grudges and jealousy
And police weh abuse dem authority
Media clowns weh nuh know bout variety
Single parents weh need some charity
Youths weh need some love and prosperity
Instead of broken dreams and tragedy
By any plan and any means and strategy
[Hook]
Say!
We got to keep on walking on the road to Zion, man 
(Nas: I've been waiting to do this track with you man! Yeah...ha ha)
(Yeah, yeah)
You know (They know)
We got to keep on walking on the road to Zion, man
(Yeah you gotta keep walking y'all,
You gotta keep...)
[Nas]
Sometimes I can't help but feel helpless 
I'm havin daymares in daytime 
Wide awake try to relate 
This can't be happenin like I'm in a dream while I'm walkin 
Cause what I'm seein is haunting
Human beings like ghost and zombies
President Mugabe holding guns to innocent bodies
In Zimbabwe
They make John Pope seem Godly
Sacrilegious and blasphemous
In my lifetime I look back at paths i've walked
Where savages fought and pastors taught 
Prostitutes stomp in high heel boots 
And badges screaming,"Young black children stop or I will shoot!"
I look back at cooked crack 
Plus cars that pass by
Jaguars mad fly
And I'm guilty for materialism 
Blacks is still up in the prison Trust that 
So save me your sorries, I'm raising an army 
Revolutionary warfare with Damian Marley 
We sparkin' the ions, marching to Zion 
You know how Nas be NYC state of mind I'm in 
[Verse 1 Repeats]
[Hook]
I got to keep on walking on the road to Zion, man
We gots to keeps it burning on the road to Zion, man
Clean and pure meditation without a doubt
Don't mek dem take you like who dem took out

Jah will be waiting there!
[Chorus 2]
Clean and pure meditation without a doubt
Don't mek dem take you like who dem took out
Jah will be waiting there we a shout
Jah will be waiting there!
In this world of calamity
Dirty looks and grudges and jealousy
And police weh abuse dem authority
Media clowns weh nuh know bout variety
Single parents weh need some charity
Youths weh need some love and prosperity
Instead of broken dreams and tragedy
By any plan and any means and strategy
Instead of broken dreams and tragedy
Youths weh need some love and prosperity 
Instead of broken dreams and tragedy
By any plan and any means and any strategy
Ay! say,

I got to keep on walking on the road to Zion, man
You know...
We got to keep on walking on the road to Zion, man

I take the roads less travelled I'm on my way
I take the roads less travelled I'll see you again some day
I take the roads less travelled well I'm on my way
When I was a young boy people try to tell me what I should be
And then a wise man sang decide your own destiny
Aunty said choices you make chances you take
To be free to be free to be free I got to be brave
I take the roads less travelled I'm on my way
I take the roads less travelled I'll see you some day
Now my daddy had a lot of women and my mama had a lot of grief
And the brethrens that surrounded him became the enemies
Cause greed can't be satisfied by money and jealousy's a disease
Oh if you don't learn from history what a blind man see
I take the roads less travelled I'm on my way
I take the roads less travelled see you again one day
The more I love the more hurt I feel
And that's all right by me cause that's just how I be
I could be like a brother sold out for a million dollar
I could be like a brother despising one another
And aunty said choices you make chances you take
And to be free to be free to be free you got to be brave
I take the roads less travelled I'm on my way
I take the roads less travelled I'll see you some day
I take the roads less travelled I'm on my way

The time is so hard
The time is so hard
The time is so hard
Coming from town, one Friday all alone
I was walking on a lonely road
Coming from town, one Friday all alone
I was walking on a lonely road
When Robber man said dem come

Don't robber man nobody shoot me sir
"my mama sent me out, to buy some mutten"
...and he says to me,

and i hope that ya pocket weight a different sumthing

Rock Stone was my pillow
Rock Stone was my pillow
Rock Stone was my pillow
I say, Rock Stone was my pillow
Rock Stone, was my pillow
[Capleton:]
And a man say
R-R-Rock stone was my pillow could not find place fi sleep
Pot dem empty we haffi find food fi eat
Everyday we terrorize by soldier and police
When the thing dem a drum and di thing dem a beat
From dem a play cowboy, and Indian, and Chief
From the first, to the third, straight up to seven street
One thing in a wi mind a fi trample di beast
And make it in a life, and inherit as the meek
Better the stone dem deh yah
Self employed, cannot get lay off
Mount a work mi have
Can't even get a day off
Who did waan fi stop mi now dem find out seh dem way off
Alright, and mi seh one by one, one by one
One by one, wi stepping out a babylon
Then one by one, one by one
Hail King Selassie the conquering lion
[Stephen Marley & Sizzla:]
Rock Stone was my pillow
Rock Stone was my pillow
Rock Stone was my pillow

Sizzla Kalonji
Rock Stone, was my pillow (Stephen Ragga Marley, aha!)
[Sizzla:]
Help us Jah
Take us from the slum
Never give up no matter what, strictly fiyah burn
Hail Rasta, take us from the slum
Never give up matter what
King Selassie I blessing come
Sufferation is thing could be no harder time
Got to widen your views, got to broaden your mind
What we face in the ghetto, nowhere else can you find
Hunger, Poverty, a system so unkind
As a matter a fact, there is an after shock
When the ground was my bed and my pillow was a rock
Try to make it through the system all the doors were lock
Yet nothing beats a try so I ain’t go stop
Mount a time they write a book on you
A set amount ah crap they'd ah put on you
Yet when yuh in the dirt they wouldn’t look on you
They would only scorn and wanna wipe the foot on yuh
So open up, Zion door
Ethiopia, Africa for sure
Liberate the poor, the poor, ehhh
Mi nah lie, true mi hail Selassie I dem wah fi war I
Read mi bible turn to peace and praise Tafari
Good bye Babylon goodbye, goodbye
Open up, zion door
Mount Zion Ethiopia for sure
Children of Israel, children of Israel, ehh
[Stephen Marley:]
Rock Stone was my pillow

Hear me now
Jah man me cool, nuh stumble like you

Eat pon table, sit inna stool

Wait til you hear, when dis riddim drop

Steve Marley ah chat, firm and strong
Doh step pon the lot
The peaceful, righteous, Rastaman
Rod of correction, inna him hand
Preachin' out to man and woman, give riches to King Solomon
Now, bass come out, and treble a top
Cap an no buck, an nuh buck a no cap
Sweetest singer, was Sugar Minott
Man a come in and ah give me a shot
Dracula turn inna vampire bat
When him see sun, him cyah take dat
Eyes dem dark, fi use contact
I pon the mic, Raggamuffin a chat
fi mi head dread, me head it no plat
Nuh fraid ah no mouse, nuh fraid ah no rat
Pray to Jah, me never will stop
We hot no cold, wah cold nuh hot
Live in a house, no live in a flat
Up inna Zion, di righteious will top
Jah blow breeze, the devil cannot
Rock Stone was my pillow
Rock Stone was my pillow
I say, Rock Stone was my pillow
Rock Stone, was my pillow.

Rock with me

So you better rock with me,
And rock with me baby all night

All night long I said
So bless, bless my little soul 
I wanna rock and roll 
I don't want to go woman, 
Woman can't you see?

Call me when you're ready yeah
Call me when your head is right
She said the words and walked into the sunset
Like a cowboy
He was standing there like he got up
From a bad dream
And he said she wanted something
He could not give her (commitment)
He is one of the men I know
Who have chosen loneliness
And called it freedom
That's why he always says
[Chorus:]
I'm a rolling stone
'Cause a rolling stone
Gathers no moss
She told him once before
She's not getting any younger you know
And when you look at her face
The years are showing
She is one of the women I know
Who wants it all in life (commitment)
He is one of the men I know
Who've taken loneliness
And called it freedom
That's why he always says
[Chorus:]
I'm a rolling stone
'Cause a rolling stone
Gathers no moss

I've been looking everywhere for you
Since the day we met
I've never been my old self again oh hoo
You don't have to believe in everything
I say right now
Cause to you I'm just another man
Until I prove myself to be
Worthy of your love you see
I'm not the kind of guy
That will bring you
Flowers everyday
I'm not the kind of guy
That will tell you
I love you in many fancy ways
Oh girl!
I've got to tell you this
I love you!
I want you
I love you!
I want you
Oh hoo hoo
[Chorus:]
I'm your Romeo
Could you be my Juliet
I know what women want
I've been around long enough
To understand it
But I want you to tell me
How to love you
'Cause I want to love you
The way you wanna be loved
It is better to have loved & lost
Than never to have loved at all
I'm not the kind of guy
That will bring you
Flowers everyday
I'm not the kind of guy
That will tell you
I love you in many fancy ways
But my girl
I've got to tell you this
I love you!
I want you
I love you!
I want you
I think I'll prove myself
To be worthy of your love
[Chorus: till fade]

Echoes of reggae comin' through my bedroom wall
Havin' a party up next door but I'm sittin here all alone
Two lovers in the bedroom and the other starts to shout
All I got is this blank stare and that don't carry no clout at all
[Chorus:]
Destination unknown
Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho
[x2]
He's singin and she's there to lend a hand
He's seen his name on the marquee but she will never understand
Once again he's leavin' and she's there with a tear in her eye
Embraces with a warm gesture it's time, time to say goodbye
[Chorus]
Ruby's heart ain't beatin cause she knows the feelin' is gone
She's not the only one who knew there's somethin' wrong
Her lover's in the distance as she wipes a tear from her eye
Ruby's fading out, she disappears, it's time, time to say goodbye
[Chorus]
Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho
Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho
Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho

Destination unknown (Ruby ruby ruby ruby soho)

Something somewhere
Is calling out your name
In the middle of the night
Your eyes go wide
I see your legs shaking
You don't believe it's happening
Oppressor man ye
Don't tell me you are scared now
It's not the end of your life
But it's the end of your kingdom
It's not the end of your life
But it's the end of your shitty kingdom
[Chorus:]
Oppressor man you running
Your kingdom is falling [x3]
Yo Yo Yo Yo
You run for your gun
To your surprise it's empty
'Cause we had those bullets
For breakfast Jah children did ye ye ye
Teargas won't make me cry anymore
Your handcuffs won't hurt my arms anymore
It's not the end of your life but it's the end of your kingdom
It's not the end of your life
But it's the end of your shitty kingdom
[Chorus]
I won't do to you
What you did to my people ye
Four hundred years ago [x2]
Turning them to slaves
Making them your prisoners
You can run but you can't hide
Your time has come now now now
[Chorus]

La-da-da, mmm...
I was given as a sacrifice
To build a black man's hell and a white man's paradise
But now that I know, it's time I've got to go, Lord
The proceeding seems so painful and so slow-slow-slow
The proceeding seems so painful and so slow
I have gathered all the wealth from all over the world
Beaten in chains and shackles
Just to help make them kings, duke and earl
But now that I know, it's time I've got to go, Lord
The proceeding seems so painful and so slow-slow-slow
The proceeding seems so painful and so slow
What I give, is what I will take
I gave love, I won't take no hate, I seh
Love-love-love, I-niversally
Love-love-love
La-da-da, mmm...
Said I was given as a sacrifice
To build a black man's hell and a white man's paradise
But now that I know, it's time I've got to go, Lord
The proceeding seems so painful and so slow-slow-slow
The proceeding seems so painful and so slow
What I give, is what I will take
I gave love, I won't take no hate, I seh
Love-love-love, I-niversally
Love-love-love, I-tinually
Love-love-love
Love is what I give
And that is what I'll take
La-da-da, mmm...

The revolutionaries...
Ya know? (Ya know...)
Look at the scars on my feet, from this road I travel
But I'm seeing change gradual, I went from an apartment to a castle
Gravel on my feet, you see I took a lot of losses
Grindin' no matter what the cause is, I got a vision so flawless
[Waka Flocka Flame:]
Gained lot of scars walking on this road
Had my share of problems, only God knows
I came from kicking doors to a million records sold
I'm a platinum artist but my wrist gold
Rather it's my freedom than to live broke
Still top swinging in this black Ghost
Tell the dealer give me mounts with no mirrors
Only looking forward, what I gotta look back for?
Cause the past 20/20 when it hindsight
Can't see these (bitches) in my blind side
Only smoke the best to keep my mind right
Cause (shit) can get sour when you're in the limelight
Used to be apartments now I'm sleeping in a mansion
Now I'm doing shows, baby dropping out them panties
Got it on my own, never had nothing handed
If you ain't come from where I come from, then you wouldn't understand it (Flocka)
Look at the scars on my feet, from this road I travel
But I'm seeing change gradual, I went from an apartment to a castle
Gravel on my feet, you see I took a lot of losses
Grindin' no matter what the cause is, I got a vision so flawless
[Waka Flocka Flame:]
I done been through the headaches and the hassles
But only God can judge me with the gavel
They say I can't rap but I can make millions
So I don't care for your opinions, I ain't asked you
I'm from south side Clayco got a tattoo
I'm a street (nigga) did what I had to
So we had to war, yeah I dabbled
Coming up wasn't easy did it gradual
Bullet scars on my body had to battle
For my life, guess this karma coming back for me
For the dirt that I did, for this fast money
Just counting callouses feet from the travel
Bounce back, what ain't kill me made me stronger
Live for today cause tomorrow never promised
Just a couple years ago we was broke (broke)
Now my bank account full of commas
(Flocka, Flocka, Flocka, Flocka, Flame)
[Stephen Marley (Waka Flocka Flame):]

Trod through the valley of the sweat and tears
And still he's searching even night and day
Can't find a gal who look so lovely
You set the standard for all prestige
You're beauty plentiful just like plenty sand on the beach
You should a keep in a showcase when guarded by police

Good thing mi no diabetic cause the way you so sweet

And express myself so the secret reveal
Gal me love you like how Georgie love cornmeal
I would like the privilege for me and you just fi deal
Well, full dedication I'm taking for real
You and me was meant to be just like a pedal and wheel
You a the treasure everyman want to steal
Excellent qualities with cross over appeal
Take you on a trip through the West Indies
Or maybe me and you can spend some time overseas
Well, smile fi awhile then she bawl yes please
Gwan Jr. Gong go show your expertise

See dem fake leaders
In the place of power they sit
From religion to politics
Riding a wave of fear
Starting fires, they don't care
Making enemies out of friends
Killing thousands, hundreds and tens
If only they could lead
The world to peace and prosperity
See dem fake leaders
Now let me explain it real quick
'Cause the system full of dem tricks
And there is something you just can't miss
No matter what you think you're fighting for
To make rich those who profit from war
Look what they're doing to us people
If only they could lead
The world to love and unity
Now I have seen where we will be
And what's good for all of humanity
Not ruled by bastions of supremacy
Or ideologies of bigotry
Some people live in their bubbles
Some people live behind their walls
Some people taken for granted
Some people taken advantage of
Now we will have to lead
The world to peace and prosperity
Yeah we will have to lead
The world to love and unity
'Cause dem fake leaders
In the place of power they sit
From religion to politics
Riding a wave of fear
Starting fires, they don't care
Making enemies out of friends
Killing thousands, hundreds and tens
Now only we can lead
The world to peace and prosperity

Been laughed at, scrutinised
To the point where I had to ask who am I
Then I remember what they do to Christ
He was nailed to a cross and crucified
Now that the light came to me
I wonder if they're gonna do the same to me
And when the truth hits painfully
That's when you know if you're really who you claim to be
For so long we've been denied
Rejected and brutalised
But jah children shall win the war
Cause we know who we are
We're selassie I children
Haile selassie children
We are Ethiopians by blood
Africa was born in us, selassie children
Haile selassie children
We know who we are
Young boy threw away his comb
So his papa told him find a different home
Never come back, hold your own
Bout you're a Rasta, I wish I never know you
Rejected for the life he choose
Cast out, all alone
The stone that the builder man refused
Shall be the head cornerstone
Soon they will realise
That we've been reading between the lines
Remember we foretold the war
You never forget who we are
Tell them, we're selassie children
Haile selassie children
We are Ethiopians by blood
Africa was born in us
Young girl gotta face the worst
Cause her mother just took a look in her purse
She find a clay kutchie and some holy herbs
And the wise mind of haile I the first
Mama say young girl you're losing your mind
Did you get these things from Satan
She say no mama I got the kutchie from jah9
And the wise mind from I nation
Please mama, don't scrutinise
Take this book and give it a try
Let this herb open up your eyes
Experience the wonders of Rastafari
Haile selassie children
We are haile selassie children
We are Ethiopians by blood
Africa was born in us
Haile selassie children
The battle will be hard
Haile selassie children
Still we never stall
Selassie children
Deh ya back a wall
Haile selassie children
Still di Natty never fall
Haile selassie children
Oh coral garden
Selassie children
Look at pinnacle
Selassie children
Still we deh ya now
Selassie children
Never giving up
Selassie children
Take no heart Gil pain
Selassie children
Fight the fights in vain
Selassie children
Even if the battle stains

Lost am I in my memories of my forefathers' legacy
I am one of you you are one of me
Why don't we set the people free
How I grieve to see fulfillment of prophecy
Naive of me to think things could change
While man remain the same so war will be for me everyday
No peace no peace for the children of Israel
Gaza cries all the tears from her eyes
Will there be no peace for the children of Palestine
Shalom salaam shalom salaam
Who will take the blame for the blood of my children
To who does vengeance belong to no one no one
We're dying from tanks and suicide bombs
The only answer is to live as one
And justice will come for my sons and just will come for my sons
Shalom salaam shalom salaam
And I wonder why and I wonder who and I wonder what
Is in the heart of you
And I wonder why and I wonder who and I wonder what
Is in the heart of you
Children are children no matter color or faith
And I wonder if history will teach us again
So war will be for me everyday
No peace no peace for the children of Israel
Gaza cries all the tears from her eyes
Will there be no peace for the children of Palestine
And justice will come for my sons
Shalom salaam shalom salaam

Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family
Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family
In Trinidad there was a family
In much confusion as you will see
It was a mama and a papa and a boy who was grown
He wanted to merry and a wive of his own
He found a young girl suited him nice
He went to his papa to ask his advice
His papa said son, I have to say no
That girl is your sister but your mama don't know
Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family
Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family
A week went by and the summer came down
Soon the best cook in the island he found
He went to his papa to make a day
His papa shook his head and to him he say
You can't merry that girl, I have to say no
That girl is your sister but your mama don't know
Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family
Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family
He went to his mama and covered his head
And told his mama what his papa has said
His mama she laughs she said go man go
Your daddy ain't your daddy but your daddy don't know
Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family
Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family
Who is real
Shame and scandal in the family

She is a woman, come take my hand
She is a woman, so true and so free
She is a woman, ideal for me
And you know, it's true, true, true
And you know, it's true, true, true
She can take the light out of the day
And paint a dark night bright
She can ease your pain when you feel insane
And make you feel all right
She can shower you with love power, yea, yea
Be a mother like no other
Even when there is no father
She is a woman, woman so strong
She is a woman, come take my hand
She is a woman, so true and so free
She is a woman, ideal for me
And you know, it's true, true, true
And you know, it's true, true, true

It's the woman inside you, see the man in me
Alone we're strong, but together we can't go wrong
So come and take my hand
And if it's cloudy or it's grey, yea, yea
We can make it all OK
And smile the tears away
She is a woman, woman so strong
She is a woman, come take my hand
She is a woman, so true and so free
She is a woman, ideal for me
And you know, it's true, true, true
And you know, it's true, true, true
She's a woman in the morning, in the evening, anytime at all
In the bedroom, in the livingroom, in the kitchen...

And she'll be sorry tomorrow
Cos she knows now what the next day will bring
She's crying for joy weeping in sorrows
Cos she knows now what the next day will bring
Now says she knows now what the next day will bring
Never let a woman tell you that she loves you
When she don't really care that much
Right not right not right yeah
Right not right not right yeah
Right not right not right yeah
Right not right not right
Never tell a woman that you love her
When you don't really care that much for her
She cryin' cryin' cryin'
She cryin' cryin' cryin'
She cryin' cryin' cryin'
She cryin' cryin' cry
And she'll be sorry tomorrow
Cos she knows now what the next day will bring
She's crying for joy, weeping in sorrows
Cos she knows now what the next day will bring
Now says she knows now what the next day will bring, hey
She feeling as if she lost
Now she pay the cost
She's way below the not
Feeling in her heart
Pain in every thought
Searching from the start, yes
She's searching from the start
Pain in every thought
Feeling in her heart
Way below the not
Now she pays the cost
Feels as if she's lost, well

It seems the world is on her shoulders and
She cryin' cryin' cryin'
She cryin' cryin' cryin'
She cryin' cryin' cryin'
She cryin' cryin' cry
And she's with child
She says it without pride
She bowed her head inside
As tears ran from her eyes
She's hurting deep inside
She cryin' cryin' cry
But she'll be sorry tomorrow
Cos she knows now what the next day will bring
She's crying for joy weeping in sorrows
Cos she knows now what the next day will bring
Let's says she knows now what the next day will bring
It's better to love and  lost than not to love at all
She thought that if she loved him he would love her from his heart, hey
Cause that's what she's been taught, but now she paid the cost
Cause love sometimes can be so blind, it hurts your very heart
And this world can be so cold
Now she's all alone, yeah
And she cryin' cryin' cryin'
She cryin' cryin' cryin'
She cryin' cryin' cryin'
She cryin' cryin' cry
But time is longer than rope
And where there is life there is hope
So keep your head up high
And don't give up the fight
Just try and try and try
She try and try and try
And Jah love is there for her
So she'll be out there tomorrow

'Cause me know the chumpas
Will not be squandered, she mek me start sing
Some Ray Charles ballad
'Cause the style of the loving is not just a fad
She need a lover to hug and squeeze her tight
She need a man to come home at night
But he's always working that's what she say
I had to tell her, go home and pray
She needs my love
She said she needs my love
She need my love
She said she need Jah love
She is a girlfriend, she live next door
I think I've seen her that face before
Her memories can't erase from my mind
I love ya angel, one of a kind
I Jr.Gong long side Yami Bolo
Come to tell you a little story about the girl next door
Certain tings can happen but she will never know
Unless she come ah di rasta man stage show

My woman is gone (woman is gone), my woman is gone (woman is gone).
She had left me a note hanging on my door:
She say she couldn't take it, she couldn't take any more.
The pressure around me - just couldn't see;
She felt like a prisoner who needs to be free.
Fools have tried, yeah - wisemen have failed:
Oh, listen to me, honey: life could never be another jail.
Still we know now: we'll never see smoke without fire
And everyone you see has a heart desire.
She's gone (she's gone), she's gone (she's gone),
she's gone (she's gone), she's gone, ye-ah!
Oh, mocking bird, have you ever heard,
Words that I never heard?
Oh, mocking bird, have you ever heard,
Words that I never heard?
She made it through the exit (she just couldn't take it);
She made it through the exit (she just couldn't make it).
And, oh, my children, if you see me cryin':
My woman is gone.
If you see me - if you see me - if you see me -
if you see me cryin' -
If you see me - if you see me - if you see me -
if you see me cryin':
She's gone (she's gone), she's gone (she's gone), she's gone, ye-ah!
Oh, mocking bird, have you ever heard,
Words that I never heard?
Oh, mocking bird, have you ever heard,

She's got a burner, yeah, yeah, yeah

It wasn't the valley of death, I was walking in
It was the valley of confusion for many years
Different religions, different beliefs
Undermining my culture
Looking down upon my tradition
Making fun of my language
Telling my children, they have no God
Finally I can tell them about,
Shembe is the way
[Chorus:]
Oh SHEMBE thank you for showing us the way.
Shembe nobunazaretha.
Oh SHEMBE thank you for healing my people.
Shembe nobunazaretha.
Shemebe is the way.
I hear them shoulting Amen,
At the top of the mountain
I hear them shouting Uyingcwele
At the top of the mountain.
No one will undermine my religion
No one will undermine my culture anymore,
Cause God sent him from above, to be with the people.
Bring them back to what is their own
Take them back to the ways Of our forefathers.
Finally I can tell generations and generations
That Shembe is the way
[Chorus:]
Oh Shemebe THANK YOU FOR SHOWING US THE WAY.
Shembe Nobunazaretha.

Baby it's been a long time
We've been sitting on drydock
And it seems like all the pathways
Have been blocked
Now the tides have turned
And the rewards we have earned
Bringing us good feeling
Set our hearts a-reeling, baby
Our ship is sailing, there ain't no stopping
Our ship is sailing, yes we are moving
Our ship is sailing, and we are moving
Our ship is sailing, there ain't no stopping
'Til we say so
Hey now
Now let's rock it steady
Since a long time we've been ready
Let nothing detract our attention
Let's take our time
'Cause I'm feeling so fine
When you hold me tight
Everything's all right, darlin'
Our ship is sailing, yes we are moving
Our ship is sailing, there ain't no stopping
Our ship is sailing, let's keep on moving
Our ship is sailing, there ain't no stopping
'Til we say so
Hey hey now
Now with love and affection
We're moving in the right direction
Satisfaction is the key along the way
So let's share the joy
Like a child with a new toy
Baby hold me tight
Everything's all right, darlin'
Our ship is sailing, and we are moving
Our ship is sailing, there ain't now stopping now
Our ship is sailing, yes we are on the go

Like a child with a new toy (Our ship is sailing)
Baby let's take our time (Our ship is sailing)
'Cause I'm feeling so fine
Babe
Yeah yeah

Should I have faith in you?
Should I put my trust in you?
And should you let me down?
Should I flirt around...
Why should I think this way?
Thinking that you're going away
There ain't no way, we'll stay
Together anymore
Am I to go on now? Living this way
Acting like a child, so young and gay
You don't know, what it means to be loved
You don't know how it feels, to be hugged, oh no!
I've got to tell you this
You're love I've tried to resist
For I just can't go on like this
Pretending each day
You make me feel so mad
You make me feel so sad
Whenever I'm to share your love
So how could I ever go on? Living this way
Acting like a child, so young and gay
You don't know, what it means to be loved
You don't know how it feels, to be hugged, oh no!
I won't come down on you
With lightning brimstone or fire
For in my heart, that isn't what I require
My desire is, for you to be true and strong
And then someday you will get to know
Where you went wrong
How could I ever go on? Living this way
Acting like a child, so young and gay
You don't know, what it means to be loved
You don't know how it feels, to be hugged, oh no!
No, you don't know, what it means to be loved
You don't know how it feels, to be hugged, oh no!

Don't close the door behind you
You might wanna go through it someday
Don't burn that bridge
You might wanna cross it someday
Your best friends today
Could be your worst enemies to morrow
Your worst enemies today
Could be your best friends tomorrow
Don't burn the bridge
Don't cross the door
[Chorus:]
And if you can't say something good about somebody
Oh shut up
And if you can't say something about somebody
Just shut up.
Ungafakaz' amanga ngomakhelwane wakho

Don't say those words that will hurt people
Don't do those things that will hurt people
The things you say today
Will come and haunt you tomorrow
The things you do today
Will come and haunt you tomorrow
Do unto others as you would like them do unto you
And if you can't say something good about somebody
Oh shut up
And if you can't say something good about somebody
Just shut up
Ungafakaz'amanga...

Silhouette...
Took a walk and passed your house late last night
All the shades were pulled and drawn way down tight
From within the dim light cast, two silhouettes on the shade
Oh what a lovely couple they made
Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes...
Put his arms around your waist, held you tight
Kisses I could almost taste, in the night
I wondered why I'm not a man, whose silhouettes on the shade
I couldn't hide those tears in my eyes
Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes...
It's true... oh yeah
Lost control and rang your bell, I was sore
Let me in or else I'll beat down your door
When two strangers who had been two silhouettes on the shade
Said to my shock you're on the wrong block
Ran down to your house with wings on my feet
Loved you like I'd never loved you my sweet
Vowed that you and I would be two silhouettes on the shade
All of our days two silhouettes on the shade
Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes...
Must come to your house with wings, on my feet
Loved you like I'd never loved, you my sweet
Vowed that you and I would be, two silhouettes on the shade
All of our days, two silhouettes
Silhouettes, silhouettes, silhouettes...
Silhouette...

Baby I'm not joking
And it's not what I'm smoking
I really think you're nice
Don't think I'm kidding you
And don't think I'm bidding
That silver words are you're price
And oh, if you could see
The change you've made in me
That the angels in the skies
Were envious and surprised
That anyone as nice as you
Would chance with me
Baby I'm not joking
And it's not what I'm smoking
I really think you're mine
Don't think I'm kidding
And don't think I'm bidding
These silver words are you're price
And oh, if you could see
The change you've made in me
That the angels in the skies
Were envious and surprised
That anyone as nice as you
Would chance with me
Would chance with me
Chance with me

Since you've been away, all I do is pray
It's only lonely nights that I've spend
There seems to be no happy day
Since you've been away, girl
My mind has gone astray
And all I do is pray that you would come my way
Sometimes I sit and concentrate
If you are gone to stay
And I hope that you would return
And make my life more gay
Since the other day, that you've been away
All I do is pray that you would come my way
Oh yeah, yeah, alright
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Since you've been away, all I do is pray
It's only lonely nights that I've spend
There seems to be no happy day
Since the other day, that you've been away
All I do is pray that you would come my way
Since you've been away, girl
And all I do is pray
It's only lonely nights I've spend
There seems to be no day
Since the other day, that you've been away
My mind has gone astray, oh-oh-oh yeah
Since you've been away
All I do is pray, oh yeah, oh yeah
Every night and day, oh yeah
Oh yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

Oh, sinner man, where you gonna run to?
Oh, sinner man, where you gonna run to?
Oh, sinner man, where you gonna run to?
All along the day
You run to the sea, the sea was a'boiling
You run to the sea, the sea was a'boiling

The Lord say, "sinner man, you should be praying"
The Lord say, "sinner man, you should be praying"
All along the day
You run to the devil, the devil was a'waiting

Long time I ah preach it
And now you come reveal it
So you've got to bow down on your knees
'Cause you can't plant corn and reap peas
Bound to reap what you sow
And you'll surely get a blow
You've got to run for cover, cover
Now that righteous come to tek over, over
Got to run and hide, you sinners
'Cause I and I was born winners
All the wrong you did, you could never succeed
'Cause I and I you could never mislead
I said you can't plant corn and reap peas
I said you can't plant corn and reap peas
Got to run and hide, you sinners
'Cause I and I was born winners
All the wrong you did, you could never succeed
'Cause I and I you could never mislead
I said you can't plant corn and reap peas, oh no
You can't plant corn and reap peas
I said you can't plant corn and reap peas
That's why you've got to bow down on your knees
Got to run and hide, you sinners

I lie awake at night
And I think about it
Where I have been
And who I've been with
'Cause all around me
I see them dropping like flies
Everytime they tell us
We say it doesn't exist
And all we wanna do
Just to have some fun
Reverand Jackson says
The time has come
That the holy book
Has been talking about
The good Rev. also said
Where there's pleasure
There will always be danger
On his knees I heard him pray so hard
He said God save your children
[Chorus:]
Save us from the sins of the flesh
Things we have learned
From our good & loving parents
When temptation comes
It all becomes useless
Like an ashtray on a motorbike
Everything you do remember
The body bag hangs
Next to the first aid kit
It's your life
It's your world
I'm just passing through
Reverand Jackson said
The time has come
That the holy book
Has been talking about
[Chorus: till fade]

Yeah
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
And if you ever say goodbye
And if you ever even try
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna love you more and more every day
I'm gonna love you more and more every day
And if you ever say goodbye

Gonna tell your mama

Just what I'm gonna do

I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you

Whoa yeah
Whoa yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Alright
Sitting here watching fools like themselves when
They should all be thinking of getting to know themselves
While life goes on everyone's got to stand strong
You can't surrender, no no no
Giving your heart and soul to vanity, yeah
Makes your life filled with pain and misery
While life goes on everyone's got to stand strong
You can't surrender, no no no, oh no
Whoa yeah
Got to be good to yourself, yeah
Whoa yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoa yeah, whoa yeah, ah yeah
Sitting here watching fools like themselves when
They should all be thinking of getting to know themselves
While life goes on everyone's got to stand strong
You can't surrender, no no no, whoa
Giving your heart and soul to vanity, yeah
Makes one's life filled with pain and misery
While life goes on everyone's got to stand strong
You can't surrender, no no, oh no

Sitting here in limbo
But I know it won't be long
Sitting here in limbo
Like a bird without a song
Well, they're putting up a resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on
Sitting here in limbo
Waiting for the dice to roll
Yeah, now, sitting here in limbo
Got some time to search my soul
Well, they're putting up a resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on
I don't know where life will leave me
But I know where I have been
I can't say what life will show me
But I know what I have seen
Tried my hand at love and friendship
But all that is past and gone
This little boy is movin' on
Sitting here in limbo
Waiting for the tide to flow
Sitting here in limbo
Knowing that I have to go
Well, they're putting up a resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on
I don't know where life will take me
But I know where I have been
I don't know what life will show me
But I know what I have seen
Tried my hand at love and friendship
That is past and gone
And now it's time to move along
Gonna lead me on now
Meanwhile, they're putting up resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on
Sitting in limbo, limbo, limbo
Sitting in limbo, limbo, limbo
Sitting in limbo, limbo, limbo
Meanwhile, they're putting up a resistance
But I know that my faith will lead me on

Skylarking, skylarking
That's what youth do today
Skylarking, skylarking
Before they stand up firm on their feet
Get a likkle work, a likkle work
And earn their bread honestly
Beggin' you a five cent, sir
Beggin' you a ten cent, sir
Cannot help, no, cannot help
So if you all keep on doing what you all are doing
You will end up, up up in jail

Ooh-ooh-oo-ooh. Oo-oo-ooh! Oo-oo-ooh.
Slave driver, the table is turn; (catch a fire)
Catch a fire, so you can get burn, now. (catch a fire)
Slave driver, the table is turn; (catch a fire)
Catch a fire: gonna get burn. (catch a fire) Wo, now!
Ev'rytime I hear the crack of a whip,
My blood runs cold.
I remember on the slave ship,
How they brutalize the very souls.
Today they say that we are free,
Only to be chained in poverty.
Good God, I think it's illiteracy;
It's only a machine that makes money.
Slave driver, the table is turn, y'all. Ooh-ooh-oo-ooh.
Slave driver, uh! The table is turn, baby, now; (catch a fire)
Catch a fire, so you can get burn, baby, now. (catch a fire)

Catch a fire: so you can get burn, now. (catch a fire)
Ev'rytime I hear the crack of a whip,
My blood runs cold.

How they brutalize the very soul.
O God, have mercy on our souls!
Oh, slave driver, the table is turn, y'all; (catch a fire)
Catch a fire, so you can get burn. (catch a fire)
Slave driver, the table is turn, y'all; (catch a fire)
Catch a fire ... [fadeout]

You'll never get away!
I saw you with your cargo
In the midst of the Atlantic, yeah
With my brothers and my sisters
Heading towards the western slave market
You kill some and you sell some
Shot some and then jail some
But what a price you've got to pay
Upon Jah Judgement day
Upon Jah Judgement day
Upon Jah Judgement day
You'll never get away!
I said I saw you with your cargo, yeah
In the midst of the Atlantic, ooh wee
With my brothers and my sisters
Heading towards the western slave market
And it grieved me so
You kill some and you sell some
Shot some and then jail some, brutally
But what a price you've got to pay
Upon Jah Judgement day
Upon Jah Judgement day, yeah
You just can't get away
That's what my Father say
No wicked can never get away
Never get away
Never, never get away

No competition, I'm making my decision, yeah
Every time I hear the music, and I make a dip, a dip
Slave master comes around and spank I with his whip, a whip
But if I don't get my desire
Then I'll set the plantations on fire
My temperature is getting much higher
Got to get what I require
'Cause every time we do the work sometimes we are hurt, oh yeah
Boss never do a thing, but hold on to his girth
But if I don't get my desire
Then I'll set the plantations on fire
My temperature is getting much higher
Got to get what I require
Every time I hear the music and I move my hip, my hip
Slave master comes around and spank I with his whip, a whip
Slave master, I'm the shepherd of my pasture
Say you work me to scorn, so 'low me make me gwaan
'Cause if I don't get my desire
Then I'll set the station on fire
My temperature is getting much higher
Got to get what I require
Slave master, I'm the shepherd of my pasture
You work me to scorn, so 'low me make me gwaan
Back off with it, 'cause I'm accustomed to your whip, yeah
And if the chalice is around, 'round, 'round
I'll surely take a sip, said I'm accustomed to your whip
Jah Jah know I'm through with it

I can remember when uh, those slavery times
What you won't and what you will
Working for your dollar bill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Walking home, a youth gets killed
Police free to shoot at will
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Nine to five, you know the drill
Weekends are a short-lived thrill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Cup runneth over till it spill
Take until they've had their fill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Some of us think we're too big
Cah the system, gives us jobs
Even though it's just a low paying gig
Some of us will boast and brag
And those of us who think we're small
Just because we don't have much
That's really not the case at all
There's riches that the flesh can't touch
Some of us won't respect names
Some of us won't respect loves
Some of us don't respect life
Even though we worship God
And some of us won't let go faith
No matter what the price may cost
Some of us won't practice hate
Becah we still believe in love
What you won't and what you will
Working for a dollar bill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Walking home, a child gets killed
Neighbours free to shoot at will
Hurts to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Nine to five, we know the drill
Weekends are such a short-lived thrill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Cup runneth over till it spill
Take until they've had their fill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Most of us think we're too good
Just because material gain
If we were living as we should
Then less of us would be in pain
Those who are misunderstood
Still deserve a voice to claim
The things that are still meaningful
To each and all of us the same
And some will say the cups half-full
And give Jah thanks for what we've gained
And some will say there's much more weight to pull
And them will tell you that straight up and plain
And some will think outside the box
While some of us will hold our lanes
And some of us rewrite the facts
While some of us a chop down cane
What men won't and what they will
Working for a dollar bill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Walking home, a child gets killed
Police free to shoot at will
Hurts to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Nine to five you know the drill
Weekends are a short-lived thrill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Cup runneth over till it spill
Take until they've had their fill
Sad to see the old slave mill
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
Is grinding slow, but grinding still
I can remember when uh, those slavery times

Ministers of religion
Have visited me many times
To talk about it
They say to me
I gotta leave it I gotta leave it
It's a bad habit
For a man
But when I try to leave it
My friends keep telling me
I'm a fool amongst fools
[Chorus:]
Now I'm a slave, a slave
I'm a slave
I'm a liquor slave
I'm a slave, a slave, slave
I'm a slave
Just a liquor slave
I have lost my dignity
I had before trying
To please everybody
Some say to me
Yo yo
I look better when I'm drunk
Some say no no no
I look bad you know
Sometimes I cry
I cry but my crying
Never helps me none
[Chorus:]
'Cause now I am a slave, a slave
I'm a slave
I'm just a liquor slave
I am a slave, a prisoner
I'm a slave
Just a liquor slave
Every night when I'm
Coming back home
My wife gets worried
'Cause she knows
Shes got double trouble
Coming home
Sometimes I cry
I cry lord I cry
But my crying
Never helps me
[Chorus: till fade]
Now I'm a slave, a slave
I'm a slave
I'm a liquor slave
I'm a slave, a slave, slave
I'm a slave
Just a liquor slave

I'm ready to be happy
I've been down too long
It's time to rise above it all
I put a big smile across my face as
I walk down joy street yeah
Follow me if you can
But leave all the burdens behind
Don't look to the past
It'll make you passteristik
Look to the future
It'll make you futuristik
Hey mister! Hey sir!
Don't open that cupboard
I don't want no skeletons falling out
I don't want no bones falling out
I don't want my past
Catching up with me
'Cause I'm happy oh...
[Chorus:]
Let sleeping dogs lie
I see two men in the street
Holding hands and kissing
The other one looks
The other one smiles
When the other one smiles
The other one blushes
I didn't wanna know
What's going on
As long as they're happy
I don't wanna look up to politicians
They're gonna feed me
Political bull
And I will have
Political diarrhoea
Don't look to the past
It'll make you passteristik
(Don't look it up -
Me just made it up)
Look to the future
It'll make you futuristik
Hey mister! Hey sir!
Don't open that cupboard
I don't want no bones falling out
[Chorus: till fade]

Why boasteth thyself
Oh, evil men
Playing smart
And not being clever?
I said, you're working iniquity
To achieve vanity (if a-so a-so)
But the goodness of Jah, Jah
I-dureth for-I-ver
So if you are the big tree
We are the small axe
Ready to cut you down (well sharp)
To cut you down
These are the words
Of my master, keep on tellin' me
No weak heart
Shall prosper
And whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall fall in it, fall in it
And whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall fall in it (... fall in it)
If you are the big tree, let me tell you that
We are the small axe, sharp and ready
Ready to cut you down (well sharp)
To cut you down
(To cut you down)
(To cut you down)
These are the words
Of my master, tellin' me that
No weak heart
Shall prosper
And whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall fall in it, uh, bury in it
And whosoever diggeth a pit
Shall bury in it, uh (... bury in it)
If you are the big, big tree
We are the small axe
Ready to cut you down (well sharp)
To cut you down
If you are the big, big tree, let me tell you that
We are the small axe
Ready to cut you down (well sharp)
To cut you down
Sharpened ...

Dread shine your light
So a child may follow
Many have been lost along the way
Until tonight
Turns into tomorrow
Teach them to be careful while at play
There's nothing wrong with having fun
Don't let the system tame you
It's just a part of being young
And even though they're quick to blame you
Picking on you like a plum
Because your dream became true
Now look what they've become
An open sight in plain view
They've already had a run
So meanwhile they try to change you
It's not over till it's done
So please remain the same you
Hey, young world (hey, young world)
Hey, young world (hey, young world)
Hey, young world
The world is yours
Hey, young world (hey, young world)
Hey, young world (hey, young world)
Hey, young world
The world is yours
Dread shine your light
So a child may follow
Many have been lost along the way
Until tonight
Turns into tomorrow
Teach them to be careful while at play
You might not think you know enough
Don't let that deter you
It's all apart of growing up
And we're all young enough to learn to
And don't you live life in a rush
The past cannot be returned to
And when you feel like giving up
Remember patience is a virtue
When you fall, try to get up
Have some guts, I'm trying to urge you
Be proud of owning up
The truth will never hurt you
Hey, young world (hey, young world)
Hey, young world (hey, young world)
Hey, young world
The world is yours
Hey, young world (hey, young world)
Hey, young world (hey, young world)
Hey, young world
The world is yours
Dread shine your light
So a child may follow
'Cause many have been lost along the way
Until tonight
Turns into tomorrow
Teach them to be careful while at play
So when you're rising start, be wise and smart
Try and make your mark
Don't you hype and floss, and drive too fast
'Cause life's too short
Try to make good times last 'cause time flies past
And if time is money, that mean time cost
But it don't cost money to joke and laugh
So if you love somebody hurry up and talk
Hey, young world (hey, young world)
Hey, young world (hey, young world)
Hey, young world
The world is yours

Aye, aye, aye, aye, yeah

The way you treat me, you control me
The way you love me

Some will not remember,
Most will never know
What life was like before the new world
Grass was clean
The air was pure
Spies weren't standing inside your doors
Teardrops fall on my shoes
Is there no time to be amused
Poor are crying to be heard
I'm crying for the world
Society my friend,
So many choices
So many devices
So many voices
Many are confused
Many are refused
So many abuse
So many rising
So many rising
So many rising
Ignorant behavior
Your strength becomes your weakness
Who will be above the fray
When the fray is getting higher everyday
Society my friend,
So many choices
So many devices
So many vices
Many are confused
Many are refused
So many abuse
So many rising
So many rising
So many rising
The Shepherds are wolves protecting their goods
And money is mightier than the pen
Greed will always take whatever it can
Maybe it must break before it bends
Some will not remember,
Most will never know
What life was like before the new world
Grass was clean
The air was pure
Spies weren't standing inside your doors
Teardrops fall on my shoes
Is there no time to be amused
Poor are crying to be heard
I'm crying for the world
Society my friend,
So many choices
So many devices
So many voices
Many are confused
Many are refused
So many abused
So many rising
So many rising
So many rising

So very, so very, so very, so very, so very
Everything they say - so much to say
They got so much things to say, so much things to say

But spiritual wickedness in 'igh and low places
So while they fight you down
Stand firm and give Jah thanks and praises
'Cos I'n'I no expect to be justified
By the laws of men - by the laws of men
Oh, true they have found me guilty
But through - through Jah proved my innocency
Oh, when the rain fall, fall, fall now
It don't fall on one man's housetop. Remember that
When the rain fall
It don't fall on one man's housetop
They singin': so very much, so very much, oh so very much
So very, very

They don't know what they're doin', yeah

So much trouble in the world
So much trouble in the world
Bless my eyes this morning
Jah sun is on the rise once again
The way earthly thin's are goin'
Anything can happen.
You see men sailing on their ego trip,
Blast off on their spaceship,
Million miles from reality:
No care for you, no care for me.
So much trouble in the world;
So much trouble in the world.
All you got to do: give a little (give a little),
Give a little (give a little), give a little (give a little)!
One more time, ye-ah! (give a little) Ye-ah! (give a little)
Ye-ah! (give a little) Yeah!
So you think you've found the solution,
But it's just another illusion!
(So before you check out this tide),
Don't leave another cornerstone
Standing there behind, eh-eh-eh-eh!
We've got to face the day;
(Ooh) Ooh-wee, come what may:
We the street people talkin',
Yeah, we the people strugglin'.
Now they sitting on a time bomb; (Bomb-bomb-bomb! Bomb-bomb-bomb!)
Now I know the time has come: (Bomb-bomb-bomb! Bomb-bomb-bomb!)
What goes on up is coming on down, (Bomb-bomb-bomb! Bomb-bomb-bomb!)
Goes around and comes around. (Bomb-bomb-bomb! Bomb-bomb-bomb!)
So much trouble in the world;
So much trouble in the world;
So much trouble in the world.
There is so much trouble (so much trouble in the world);
There is so much trouble;
There is so much trouble (so much in the world);
There is so much trouble;
There is so much trouble in the world (so much trouble in the world);
There is (so much in the world);
(So much trouble in the world)

Eveyting inna we make sure we did right
Give you all a me loving sincerely
Just make sure we keep the thing tight
Well, I might not be there, as much as I want to

A day without the shining sun

One look and we feel as one
'Cause that's how easy we communicate
No heart's got to find guarantee
Girl, your love can depend on me
If love, could sign a dotted line
You would surely see your name next to mine
And you would surely see your name next to mine
You would surely see your name next to mine

Stand for the truth you stand alone
Government will cover up
I saw a man sitting in a room
Holding a gun to his head
He said man oh man
What am I gonna do
I can't change the past but I can change the future
If I pull this trigger right now, right here
Everything will be over
Not a day goes by I don't see them in my dreams
Not a day goes by I don't hear them screaming in my ears
Begging for mercy, pleading innocent
Since my heart is made up to be as cold
As the barrel of this gun I hold
I would pull the trigger anyway
[Chorus:]
I was a soldier, following instructions from a man
We have known as the general
So many medals, so many praises
Nothing can take away the guilt
That I feel inside me
Government covered up every crime we committed
Against human kind
Not a day goes by, I don't see them in my dreams
Not a day goes by, I don't hear them crying in my ears

Teacher teacher teacher
Ever since we came to town
You don't look a happy man
Is our mission a threat to yours
In case you don't know
Who we are
I'm gonna tell you
Who we are
We are the men your father
Warned you about
We are the men your mother
Told you to stay away from
We are the

Soldiers for righteousness
We fight against tribalism
We fight against oppression
We fight against corruption
We fight against racism
We fight against apartheid
We are the men your mother
Warned you about little boy
We are the men your oppressive father
Told you about
We are the soldiers for righteousness
And we are not sent here

We're sent by the suffering
We're sent by the oppressed

Warned you about
We are those men your oppressive father
Told you to stay away from

It's getting to the point 
Where I can't hang around no more 
It's getting to the point 
Where really have to open up the door 
Times are changing 
You better use your sense 
Use what you've got 
From coincidence 
Hear me now! 
Sooner or later you gonna have to stand up tall 
Sooner or later when your backs against that wall 
Sooner or later you'll have to be the one you are 
And you just might find that you're out of time 
And it's just too late 
Hear me now! 
Heavy burden gets you down 
And pressure is all around 
Sit around and hesitate 
Say you're waiting for a lucky break 
Life's for living 
Better use your sense 
Use what you've got 
From coincidence 
Hear me now! 
Sooner or later you gonna have to stand up tall 
Sooner or later when your backs against that wall 
Sooner or later you'll have to be the one you are 
Or you just might find that you're out of time 
And it's just too late 
Heavy burden gets you down 
And pressure is all around 
You sit around and hesitate 
Say you're waiting for the lucky break 
Life's for living 
Better use your sense 
Use what you've got 
From coincidence 
Hear me now! 
Sooner or later you gonna have to stand up tall 
Sooner or later when your backs against that wall 
Sooner or later you'll have to be the one you are

I'm a rebel, soul rebel
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer
See the morning sun
On the hillside
Not living good, yeah! Travel wide
Said, I'm a living man
I've got work to do
If you're not happy, children
Then you must be blue
(Must be blue, must be blue) people say
I'm a rebel, let them talk,
Soul rebel, talk won't bother me.
I'm a capturer, that's what they say,
Soul adventurer, night and day.
I'm a rebel, soul rebel
Do you hear them lippy?
I'm a capturer, gossip around the corner,
Soul adventurer. How they adventure on me
But see a morning sun
On the hillside
Not living good, travel wide
Said, I'm a living man
I've got work to do
If you're not happy, you must be blue
I'm a rebel, soul rebel
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer
Do you hear me?
I'm a rebel, rebel in the morning
Soul rebel, rebel at midday time

Walking in the darkness
Like a predator from the wild
Looking for those who are gasping
For the last breath to take them away
Some to a better place
Some to a place where
The fires never stop burning
You can cry for help
No one is listening
'Cause everyone is deaf
From the death that is surrounding them
No angel takes you home
No angel takes you to heaven
But the soul taker comes
And takes your soul away
His eyes shines wild fire
And he' s here to take you away
He's the...
[Chorus:]
Soul taker, soul taker
Soul taker takes your soul
You gotta be ready

There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
It is a special one
It's never seen the sun
It only comes up when the moon is on the run
And all the stars are gleaming
It's growing in the street
Right up through the concrete
But soft and sweet and dreaming
There is a rose in Spanish Harlem
A red rose up in Spanish Harlem
With eyes as black as coal
That looks down in my soul
And starts a fire there and then I lose control
I have to beg your pardon
I'm goin' to pick that rose
And watch her as she grows
In my garden
I'm goin' to pick that rose
And watch her as she grows
In my garden
La la la...
My beautiful rose

I grew up inna place called De La Vega
Spanish Town Rocking

I pray thee, I pray thee once again
I wonder to be surrounded by ones with such talent
You know
Speak life
Live a humble and meek life
Ordinary day of the week life
Try to search and seek life
Way up
Keep your head up and stay up
Even when you sore and pain love
Never giving up till its game up
Keep your aim up
And focus
Don't concentrate on what's bogus
Never sell out for a bonus
Handle your bis like grown ups
Own up
It's amazing
The way Jah fire keeps blazing
That's why I constantly praise him
For some of them it's a phase thing
So they're gazing
On the street lights
Till dem catch up in street fights
'Cause are pretending they're street wise
And put an end to a brief life
I feel like
It's a mystery
How we can keep repeating our history
Making the same mistakes as our ancestry
Seem like all of life lessons missed with
It's risky
So give praises
One day you may find your oasis
Rise up to the challenge you're faced with
Be a pool and creative
You'll make it
Its basics
People been doing it for ages
Many other cultures and places
On the regular basis
They're so many cases
Lets face it (man)
Way too much time has been wasted (man)
Building military bases
Fighting our war with no basis
Life is sacred
And every baby born naked
Some a nah gwaan like dem raise big
And don't care what they're making
They can't take it
So speak life (man)
All this darkness no feel right (man)

Where there's, more hungry mouths
Than food to eat
It's where the homeless
Roam the street
Where broken glass
And broken dreams
Are shattered and scattered
Amongst debris
Sufferation wrath
And still they laugh
And dream of a mansion
Above the half
No one to speak
Upon there behalf
Now tell me do they stand a chance?
Where there's, more food
Than mouths to feed
Where you find those who
Claim to lead
Because of all their personal greed
They always want more than they need
They don't help those
Below the half
Instead they stand aside and laugh
As if it's all we'll ever ask
When will they make a change?
[CHORUS (Yami Bolo)]
Children lift your heads
To the one
Who create the sun
My children
And your light will come shinning again
Show the world
Jah love is okay
When we rise and greet the sun
Lets give him thanks and praise
[VERSE]
Illegal guns
They roam the night
In hungry hands
Waiting to bite
The first sign of
Any food in sight
Youths in the dark
Searching for light
Hard time they face
Is not a choice
Police curfew
Is no surprise
And with no one
To be there voice
Do they stand a chance?
Where there's, more hungry mouths
Then food to eat
Where you find those who
Claim to lead
Because of all there personal greed
They always want more than they need
They don't help those
Below the Ave
Instead they stand aside and laugh
As if it's all we'll ever ask
When will they make a change?
[VERSE]
Its like a punk never check
Or dem did forget
Say a death
We nature naughty
Ah true mi go born uptown
Tell dem fools don't cross me
That's only where Cindy brought me
And that's why they can't impress me
With no boasty car
Me know dat ah kill dem softly
And then they're not
Really even who they think they are
They're not really moving crafty
Mi get fi understand
Say them plan dem faulty
Well nuff a dem a twenty
And favor forty
Filthy rich big belly
And hearty
Di real Gideon will
Be arriving shortly
Rasta nuh beat Binghi
Drum we claatt it
We live longer
Cause we food nuh salty
We grow stronger
And dem can't assault we
So haile Rastafari love
And exhalt it

Stiff-necked fools, you think you are cool
To deny me for simplicity.
Yes, you have gone for so long
With your love for vanity now.
Yes, you have got the wrong interpretation
Mixed up with vain imagination.
So take Jah Sun, and Jah Moon,
And Jah Rain, and Jah Stars,
And forever, yes, erase your fantasy, yea-eah!
The lips of the righteous teach many,
But fools die for want of wisdom.
The rich man's wealth is in his city;
The righteous' wealth is in his Holy Place.
So take Jah Sun, and Jah Moon,
And Jah Rain, and Jah Stars,
And forever, yes, erase your fantasy, yeah!
Destruction of the poor is in their poverty;
Destruction of the soul is vanity, yeah!
So stiff-necked fools, you think you are cool
To deny me for simplicity, yea-ea-eah!
Yes, you have gone - gone for so long
With your love for vanity now.
But I don't wanna rule ya!
I don't wanna fool ya!
I don't wanna school ya:
Things you - you might never know about!
Yes, you have got the wrong interpretation
Mixed up with vain - vain imagination:
Stiff-necked fools, you think you are cool
To deny me for, o-ooh, simplicity. [fadeout]

Still Is Still Moving to Me
With Willie Nelson
Still is still moving to me
I swim like a fish in the sea
All the time
But if that's what it takes to be free
I don't mind
Still is still moving to me
Still is still moving to me
And it's hard to explain how I feel
It won't go in words
But I know that it's real
I can be moving or I can be still
But still is still moving to me
Still is still moving to me

Some girl in the twinkling of an eye
Dem ah ready fi come pull down mi Karl Kani
Oh, come on now tell me how can I
Love ah, one dat really don't deserve me?
Natural fi keep and natural preserve me
Me is ah boy, could get a whole heep ah girl, ya heard me
Many are called but only few deemed worthy
Body have ta physically strong and sturdy
Spiritually balanced fi clean and purge me
Mentally advanced fi always urge me
Read couple books and challenge the clergy
Read a couple psalms up inna the morning early
Could you be so kind then show me a sign
I've been searching and it's so hard to find
Decent values with a decent wine
Decent jubee running it down the line
Maybe it's my mind, maybe I'm blind
Maybe it's the way that I've been spending my time
I'm still searching for a fine peace of mind
Decent jubee running it down the line
A little child has grown and he's got love on his mind
But what he'll never know a virtuous woman is hard to find
And dat's when she said she feels the pain
And she'll never fall in love again
So if you is a gal with whole heep of value
What a valuable nice and decent gal you
When I get you I'll be glad I got you
Then stand firmly inna your life like statue
Seen some old tings seen some young tings
Seen some little silly go and come tings
Seen some one night just for fun tings
What a indecent piece ah, some ting
Be so kind den show me a sign
I've been searching and it's so hard to find
Decent values with a decent wine
Decent jubee running it down the line
Maybe it's my mind, maybe I'm blind
Maybe it's the way that I've been spending my time
I'm still searching for a fine peace of mind
Decent jubee running it down the line
Some say that love is blind
But he keep saying, not this time
So all he need is love to keep his heart in line
But dat's when she said, "Lord I feel the pain"
And she'll never fall in love again
You have some gal ah, come 'pon man premises
And ah, fling up the ting that's between di knees
And ah, full up man head with false promises
Oh, dutty bungle please, couldn't want to run that
So fast wid ease been there dun that my main
Squeeze is natural, simply natural
Could you be so kind then show me a sign
I've been searching and it's so hard to find
Decent values with a decent wine
Decent jubee running it down the line
Maybe it's my mind, maybe I'm blind
Maybe it's the way that I've been spending my time
I'm still searching for a fine peace of mind
Decent jubee running it down the line
A little child has grown and he's got love on his mind
But what he'll never know a virtuous woman is hard to find
'Cause that's when she said she's feeling pain
It seems they have fallen in love again
That's when she said, "Lord I feel the pain"
And now they're standing in love again
So tell me ah, when price tag gone pon annany
Gal ah, love man for Benz and Ferrari
Little one eyed brethren weh name Omari
Couldn't get no loving since him start sell stary
Some girl in the twinkling of an eye
Dem ah ready fi come pull down mi Karl Kani
Oh, come on now tell me how can I
Love ah, one dat really don't deserve me?

With the world so loud, who's gonna hear, when I cry
in this fog of war for black gold, one diamond sold, one life got stole
society built on slavery, for me it was not so long ago
you may forget, but I still know
Still the storms come, from the coast of West Africa [repeat]
anger and rage, thunder and lightning, spirits unrest hey they looking for justice
still the storms come, from the coast of West Africa [repeat]
flood of tears rise, for stories untold, a debt to be paid, hey don't you know
There heroes, are my enemies for one man's profit is another man's loss
and I see their faces in stone and steel with eyes so proud, oh I wish they could feel
for I am come, with the chain and ball to shatter your images, and break down these walls
so this day may be bright free from the shadows of giants in the light
I'm out of my mind
[Chorus]
Eternity is not enough for me to forget, and my children's children, you will regret
for I warn you of a time when empires fall, and the lowly will be lifted hey rule them all
but vengeance is no glory, hate is no pay, truth is my call and peace is my way
so I will endure, through these hard times, while I am neglected and paid no mind
[Chorus]

Stop that train: I'm leavin' - today!
Stop that train: I'm leavin' - anyway!
Stop that train: I'm leavin'. And I said:
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong;
I said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong.
All my good life I've been a lonely man,
Teachin' my people who don't understand;
And even though I tried my best,
I still can't find no happiness.
So I got to say:
Stop that train: I'm leavin' - oh, baby now!
Stop that train: I'm leavin' - don't care what you say!
Stop that train: I'm leavin'. And I said:
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong;
Said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong.
Some goin' east; and-a some goin' west,
Some stand aside to try their best.
Some livin' big, but the most is livin' small::
They just can't even find no food at all.
I mean, stop it:
Stop that train: I'm leavin' - leavin', mm-hmm.
Stop that train: I'm leavin' - I don't mind!
Stop that train: I'm leavin'. And I said:
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong;
I said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong.
Stop that train: I'm leavin' - leavin'!
Stop that train: I'm leavin' - can't take it!
Stop that train: I'm leavin' - got to be better!
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong;
I said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong. [fadeout]

Storms, storms are raging
And life, good life is disappearing
The dragon has come
His work has begun
So beware, children, beware

Every man has a right to live
Love is all that we have to give
Together we struggle by our will to survive
And together we fight just to stay alive
Struggling man has got to move
Struggling man no time to lose
I'm a struggling man
And I've got to move on
As the sun lights the day and the moon lights the night 
Struggling man keeps reaching for the higher heights
So we plan for tomorrow as we live for today
Like a flower we bloom, and then later fade away
Struggling man has got to move
Struggling man no time to lose
I'm a struggling man 
And I've got to move on
Struggling man has got to move
Struggling man no time to lose
I'm a struggling man 
And I've got to move on
Struggling man, struggling man
Struggling man, struggling man
Struggling man, struggling man

The night is almost over
The day is almost here
Let the light of your face
Replace the darkness of my tears

(Ow, ow-ow-ow-ow!
Ow, ow-ow-ow-ow!)
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
How can you be sitting there
Telling me that you care -
That you care?
When every time I look around,
The people suffer in the suffering
In everyway, in everywhere.
Say: na-na-na-na-na (na-na, na-na!):
We're the survivors, yes: the Black survivors!
I tell you what: some people got everything;
Some people got nothing;
Some people got hopes and dreams;
Some people got ways and means.
Na-na-na-na-na (na-na, na-na!):
We're the survivors, yes: the Black survivors!
Yes, we're the survivors, like Daniel out of the lions' den
(Black survivors) Survivors, survivors!
So I Idren, I sistren,
A-which way will we choose?
We better hurry; oh, hurry; oh, hurry; wo, now!
'Cause we got no time to lose.
Some people got facts and claims;
Some people got pride and shame;
Some people got the plots and schemes;
Some people got no aim it seems!
Na-na-na-na-na, na-na, na!
We're the survivors, yes: the Black survivors!
Tell you what: we're the survivors, yeah! - the Black survivors, yeah!
We're the survivors, like Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego
(Black survivors),
Thrown in the fire, but-a never get burn.
So I Idren, I-sistren,
The preaching and talkin' is done;
We've gotta live up, wo now, wo now! -
'Cause the Father's time has come.
Some people put the best outside;
Some people keep the best inside;
Some people can't stand up strong;
Some people won't wait for long.
(Na-na-na-na-na!) Na-na-na, na-na-na na!
We're the survivors
In this age of technological inhumanity (Black survival),
Scientific atrocity (survivors),
Atomic misphilosophy (Black survival),
Nuclear misenergy (survivors):
It's a world that forces lifelong insecurity (Black survival).
Together now:
(Na-na-na-na-na!) Na na-na na na! (Na na-na na na!)
We're the survivors, yeah!
We're the survivors!
Yes, the Black survivors!
We're the survivors:
A good man is never honoured (survivors)
in his own yountry (Black survival).
Nothing change, nothing strange (survivors).
Nothing change, nothing strange (Black survivors).
We got to survive, y'all! (survivors) - [fadeout]

You're gonna leave me, you're gonna leave me
My sweet sweet Jenny
I told you that I love you and no one else
Now you're going, yes you're going to leave me all alone in pain
You're going to leave me
You're going to leave me, my sweet sweet Jenny
I know someday you will realize
What you did to me is wrong
I know someday you will understand
And want to come back to me
(Don't come back to me no more)

Listen
The first time I saw your face
Was the first I met you, girl
You told me you love me
You told me you care
Three months after I saw you there
I whispered my name, so softly
You should remember the first time we met
I take a look in the mirror
And I couldn't see myself at all
I saw someone else
Just staring and looking at me
I can't help myself
While all those stares are on me
I can't help myself
While all those stares are on me
The second time I saw you there
I could not believe the scene, yeah
I've never been happy
I've always been blue
The first time I saw your face
Was the first I met you, yeah now
I've never been happy
I've always been blue, Lord man
I take a look to the sea
And I caught those row boats looking at me
I can't help myself
While all those stares are on me
I take a look in the mirror
And I couldn't see myself at all
I saw someone else
Just staring and looking at me
I can't help myself
While all those stares are on me
I can't help myself
While all those stares are on me

All this pain in this world
All the crying in this world
I'll take it to Jah
All the worries in this world
And all the troubles in this world
I will take to Jah
All the suffering
Right where we are
I'll take to my father
'Cause he said
Come to I with all thine sins
And I will wash away
All the impurities
He said I'm your father
The creater of everything
That's what I say
[Chorus:]
All this pain I'll take to Jah [x2]
All these worries I'll take to Jah [x2]
Come to I with your problems
No problem too big or small
No one no one will be rejected
I'm your father the creater
OH-HO-HO-HO Lord I cry [x2]
Even when Satan comes
With him demons
Turn everything I believed in
Upside down
I will never forget mmm
With Jah on our side
Who can be against us
Oh no
Most high-omnipotent one
Praise him most high
[Chorus:]
All this pain I'll take to Jah
All this crying I'll take to Jah

Listen
Almost heaven, West Jamaica
True ridge mountains, shining down the river
All my friends there, older than those ridge
Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze
Country roads take me home
To the place I belong
West Jamaica, my ol' momma
Take me home country roads
I heard her voice, in the mornin' hour she calls me
Said "Son you remind me of my home far away"
And drivin' down the road I feel a sickness
I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
All my memories, all gathered 'round her
My my lady swingin' through the water (water)
Dark and dusty painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, tears fall out my eyes
Country roads take me home
To the place I belong
West Jamaica, my ol' momma
Take me home country roads
Country roads take me home
To the place I belong
West Jamaica, my ol' momma
Take me home country roads
Country roads take me home
To the place I belong
West Jamaica, my ol' momma
Take me home country roads

Now the sun is in my eyes
And you know I'm feeling fine, take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now
Where the reggae rhythms beat
Can't help but move my feet, take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now
Where we can live in the country
Eat fruits from the tree, everything's irie
The coconut water is sweet
Where the three little birds they sing
Blue Mountains are happy again, take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now
Feel the Caribbean breeze
Stress is calling but I can't be reached, take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now
Where we can meet with good people
Dance all the day, singing don't worry
One love, one heart, one aim, aim, aim
Hummingbirds humming by
(Ooh, ooh)
See the pretty yellow butterfly, take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now
In the night hear the crickets sing
Fireflies are jamming, so take me
(Take me)
Take me to Jamaica now
Where we can live in the country
Eat fruits from the tree, everything's irie
The coconut water is sweet, yeah
Now the sun is in my eyes
And you know I'm feeling fine, take me

Take me to Jamaica now
Where the reggae rhythms beat
I can't help but move my feet, take me

She says she loves me more than I do
And she says she's sorry
She promised me everything too
She tells me not to worry
But listen baby, make up your mind
Or both of us you will lose

Waste your life if you want

Waste your life if you want

With lovely accent when I talk

The way I dance when I walk

Well, I know there is Jah out there to be found
Yes, I know there is Jah out there to be found
What they seem to have found
See they claim to be who they aren't
What they seem to have found
Falsely proclaimed, popes and priests
They claim they are the closet to God
But who are you, and how can you be
How can you be who you aren't?
All they do is talk
Yes, all they do is talk
Dem chatty mouth a bark
Well all they do is talk

But they don't know fart
Some intellectuals think they know a little of everything
But they don't know naught, naught
Hey, it's not what's on the outside my brethren
It's what's in the heart
And the real you is inside of you my sistren
You know who you really are
All they do is talk
Yes, all they do is talk
That's all they do is talk
Watch them chatty mouth a bark
Blessed be Jah my rock who teaches my hands
To wage war and my fingers to do the battle
My love, my fortress, my strong hold, my deliverer, my shield in whom I've taken
Refuge and the one who subdues my people under me
Oh Jah, what is man? Man is breath, his days are like passing shadow
Oh, Lord, bow down thy heavens and descend, touch the mountains so that they
Smoke, flash forth the lightning and strike them, shoot forth thy arrows and
Confound them
I know there is revolution brewing, I can see
People, I know there is a solution in you and me
Now they think they can fool all the people
But they can't and they ain't
Yes, they think they can fool all the people
But they ain't 'cause they can't
Falsely proclaimed leaders
They claim they're the leaders of men
But what is this, who are you?
And how can you be, how can you be
Who you ain't?
All they do is talk
Yes, all they do is talk
Promise you this, promise you that
Chat behind the innocent back...
Them chatty mouth a bark
Yes all they do is talk
Them chatty mouth a bark
And all they do is talk
Promise you this, promise you that
Chat behind the innocent back...
All they do is talk, them chatty mouth a bark...
Them chatty mouth a bark and them can't defend them talk

Yeah, I've been down on the rock for so long, (so long)
I seem to wear a permanent screw; (screw-oo-oo-oo-oo)
I've been down on the rock for so long, (so long)
I seem to wear a permanent screw. (screw-oo-oo-oo-oo)
But-a I - I'm gonna stare in the sun,
Let the rays shine in my eyes.
I - I'm a gonna take a just-a one step more
'Cause I feel like bombin' a church -
Now - now that you know that the preacher is lyin'.
So who's gonna stay at home
When - when the freedom fighters are fighting?
Talkin' blues (talkin' blues), talkin' blues (talkin' blues):
They say your feet is just too big for your shoes, woe-oh-oh-oh!
Talkin' blues (talkin' blues), keep on talkin' blues (talkin' blues);
They say - you hear what they say -
Didn't you hear?
Cold ground was my bed (bed last night),
Rockstone - rockstone - rockstone was my pillow;
Cold ground was my bed last night (bed last night),
And rock was my pillow, too.

I pay my gardener
To clean up my garden
I pay my doctor
To check out da other ting
I pay my lawyer
To fight for my rights
And I pay my bodyguard
To guard my body
There's only one man I pay
But I don't know what I'm paying for
I'm talking about the taxman [x3]
[Chorus: x4]
What have you done for me lately
Mr taxman
You take from the rich
Take from the poor
You even take from me
Can't understand it now
I pay for the police
To err... I don't know why
'Cause if my dollar was good enough
There wouldn't be so much crime
In the streets
They tell me you're a fat man
And you always take and
Never give
[Chorus: till fade]

It takes a million people
To build up a good reputation
But it takes one stupid fool
To destroy everything they done
The world knows your people as
The most violent in the world
The world knows your nation as
The most oppresive in the world
Take it upon yourself
To restore your nation's dignity
Yo ho ho ho ho ho ho
[Chorus:]
Teach the world
Teach them right
It takes a million lives
To get the respect you deserve
When people see your kind
Some of them would run a mile
The world knows your people as
A nation of crooks
Everyone around you should
Always keep their eyes opened
The world knows your nation as
A nation of drug lords
Everyone blames your people
For the destruction of the world
Take it upon yourself
To restore your nation's dignity
Ho ho ho ho ho ho
[Chorus: till fade]

Went away to a far far land, spent some time in New York,
Most of my time inna England, no welcome back to my bornland.
Come from england to make some vibes, just to keep my fans alive
But the vibes they're teaching me, that don't right in my book, no
Yes the vibes they're teaching me, that don't right in my book, like
No put de day nah put dem no weh, no put de day lawd I went dem a stay,
Sex an guns jus keep dem to de ground horse tonic a mek de girls dem panic
Teach de youths dem how to live,
Teach de youths dem how to survive
Hold your corner and save your life and thats no jive.
Some of de youths dem make a living by selling some stones, 
While some make a living wiping down cars, 
Cant you see the times your living in? the people are suffering.
Don't teach me nothing just teach me something 
Don't teach me nothing just teach me something
Hold your corner  save your life and thats no jive.
My heart, my poor little heart, my heart cries to see the youth.
No put de day nah put dem no weh, no put de day lawd I went dem a stay,
Sex an guns jus keep dem to de ground horse tonic a mek de girls dem panic
Teach de youths dem how to live,
Teach de youths dem how to survive
Hold your corner and save your life and thats no jive.

September 11th
Well it was Hell in Heaven
A Hell of a day
In the US of A
Terror hit the World Trade Center
In New York City
And the Pentagon
In the city of Washington
I saw it on T.V.
I thought that I was watching a movie
Like it was World War III
In the land of the brave and the home of the free
Where was 007
September 11th
And Superman
When they called 911
Now there's a war against terror, terror
Terror fighting terror
Terror, terror
Oh what a horror
Now there's a war against terror, terror
Terror fighting terror
Terror, terror
Oh what a horror
Terror, terror, terror
We must have a better tomorrow
We must have a better tomorrow now
September 11th
Another war in Heaven
All who were there
Said it was a living nightmare
But for every action
There has to be a reaction
This is the law of nature
Now we're living in the future
So when you're digging a ditch
I think you better dig two
One for the other man
And one for you
And when you're pointing a finger
When three points back at you
Be sure your hands are clean
I think you know what I mean
'Cause when you war against terror, terror
Terror fighting terror
Terror, terror
Oh what a horror
Terror, terror
Biological
Terror, terror
Environmental
Terror, terror, terror
We must have a better tomorrow
We must have a better tomorrow now
11th of September
The world will always
The year 2001
A new era begun
This was a wake-up call
To nations great and small
Terror been with you all the time
But you never paid it no mind
Oh, it's the Armageddon
A clash of civilization
With terror fighting terror
Tell me who can be the hero
I read it in Revelation
That there would be lamentation
A tale of God and the Devil
But good must overcome evil

[Chorus:]
I said I
I'm gonna testify
What Jah has done for I
When I'm down he picks me up
When I'm empty he fills my cup
When obstacles are in my way
He remove them for me I say
[Chorus]
When my friends try to fight me down
Jah says I'm still around
When they dig pits in my way
He remove them for me I say
[Chorus]
Satan is working every day
Trying to lead you all astray
Be careful of who you obey
Or you'll be going in Satan's way
[Chorus]
While I'm walking through this land
He make me to be a better man
He taught me how to overstand
And he always he lead me by my hand
[Chorus]
Every day
Every time
I've got to testify
What Jah has done for I

[Chorus:]
That's what your friends will do
That's what they will do
They will come with great pretense
To gain your confidence
They'll take you round the bend
And fry you in the end
[Chorus]
They will look right inna you eyes
And tell you the wickedest lies
Make you promises
But never accomplishes
[Chorus]
They will dress up inna you clothes
And punch you inna you nose
Dress up inna you shoes
And still carry false news
[Chorus]
They will know that you in jail
And never try to get you bail
And know that you in trouble
And try to make it double
[Chorus]
They will steal you only goat
And then them cutting throat
If you ever robbed
Woulda come back for you car

If you know what's good for you
Stay out of his way
If you have no insurance
Stay out of his sight
He's a bully, from Soweto
I can tell he's looking for a fight
Look at his face
I can tell he's looking for a fight
Look at his nose, he kills for fun
He's one of those people we were warned about
So many years ago
His days gonna come
Every dog has his day
[Chorus:]
Sinners shall never go to heaven [x4]
If you're on the right side of the law, don't be where he is
He is wanted dead or alive
He kills for fun, stay out of his way
I can tell he's looking for a fight
Look at his face
I can tell he's looking for a fight
Look at his nose
He's a bully from Soweto
In his world dog eat dog
That is how we know his day is gonna come
Every dog has his day

Haile Selassie is the Chapel
Power of the Trinity
Build your mind on this direction
Serve the living God and live
Take your troubles to Selassie
He is the only King of Kings
Conquering Lion of Judah
Triumphantly we all must sing
I search and I search on book of Man
In the Revelation, look what I find
Haile Selassie is the Chapel
And the world should know
That man is the Angel
Our God, the King of Kings
Let me tell you I search and I search on book of life
In the Revelation, see what I find
Haile Selassie is the Chapel
He is the only King of Kings
Conquering Lion of Judah
Triumphantly we all must sing...

By the look on your face, girl, you're my enemy
By the look on your face, girl, you're my enemy, yeah
Remember that Friday night
When you stole my pants off the line
So please tell me how you wanna make love to me
Whoa, girl
By the look in your eyes, girl, you're a cheater
By the look in your eyes, girl, you're a cheater
Going around and stealing people's clothing every day
Oh, please tell me, do you wanna be a cheater?
Whoa oh girl, oh girl, whoa girl
Going around and stealing people's clothing every day
Oh, please tell me, do you wanna be a cheater?
Whoa, girl, whoa

I see Johnny with his head hanging down
Wondering how many schillings left in that pound
Cost of living it is rising so high
Dollar see that have heart attack and die
Bills and budgets are waiting
Finance ministers anticipating
Unemployment is rising
And I hear my people, they're crying
The day the dollar die
Things are gonna be better
The day the dollar die
No more corruption
The day the dollar die
People will respect eachother
The day the dollar die
Tell me brother
Is there something I can do
Don't you let frustrations make you blue
Time is hard
And I know that is true
But if you pick yourself up
That's all you've got to do
Things can be much better
If we can come together
Long time we been divided
And it's time we be inited
The day the dollar die
Gonna be better
The day the dollar die
I won't need no pockets
The day the dollar die
Don't have to be frettin'
The day the dollar die
Now I see you standing on your feet
And you can also make two ends meet
Never you let life problems get you down
There is always a solution to be found
Bills and budgets are mourning
Finance ministers groaning
Unemployment is rising
And I hear my people crying from the ghetto
The day the dollar die
It's gonna be nice
The day the dollar die
Just you wait and see
The day this here dollar die
There be no more inflation
The day the dollar die
I say the day Danny dollar die
The day Sammy dollar die
We will love eachother
I said the day this a dollar die
Fight some inflation

Who doesn't care about the poor people?
What type of rich man are you
Who doesn't care about the helpless people?

There you read it in the Bible
But don't understand what it says
It says blessed is the hand that giveth
Than the one that taketh
Blessed is the hand that giveth
Than the one that taketh
Blessed is the hand that giveth
Than the one that taketh
Does it make you feel happy
When you see another man starving?
Does it make you feel happy
When you see another man with no food?
Does it make you feel great, maybe?
To see another man, without a thing
You read about it in the Bible
But didn't understand it
Blessed is the hand that giveth
Than the one that taketh
Blessed is the hand that giveth
Than the one that taketh
Blessed is the hand that giveth

Well, they tell me of a pie up in the sky
Waiting for me when I die
But between the day you're born and when you die
They never seem to hear even your cry
So as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share now, what's mine
And then the harder they come
The harder they fall, one and all
Ooh, the harder they come
The harder they fall, one and all
Well, the oppressors are trying to keep me down
Trying to drive me underground
And they think that they have got the battle won
I say forgive them Lord, they know not what they've done
'Cause, as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share now, what's mine
And then the harder they come
The harder they fall, one and all
Ooh, the harder they come
Harder they fall, one and all
And I keep on fighting for the things I want
Though I know that when you're dead you can't
But I'd rather be a free man in my grave
Than living as a puppet or a slave
So as sure as the sun will shine
I'm gonna get my share now, what's mine
And then the harder they come
The harder they fall, one and all
Ooh, the harder they come
Harder they fall, one and all
Hey, the harder they come
Harder they fall, one and all
What I say now
What I Say now
What I say now
What I say, one time 
The harder they come, the harder they fall, one and all
The harder they come, the harder they fall, one and all

Rose gold watch
All white ring
All black ghost
Cruising the Kingston streets
It's the big belly, mon
Pull up in that Rolls Royce, can you hear the Wailers?
Hustle like I'm Bob Marley, destined for the greatest
I remember flipping, sleeping on a pissy mattress
Man over night filling in my father's absence
Coming from the bottom, all we did was hustle
Tryna to get a dollar with a kilo in the oven
I smoke like a boss, Trench Town scars
Shotta like Ky-Mani, I'm just tryna live large
Penthouse suite, great bowl of weed
Blue mountain coffee, spend time with a G
Looked up in the sky, I can make it rain
The son of a legend and his message is the same
I see the tears on your face
Don't you weep, no baby
All this love is not in vain
I'll shelter you through the rain
The mis-takes that I made
Left us, both feeling pain
And the lion roars, when she cries
And I don't want her crying no more
Strictly kissing and hugging
Keep consensual loving
She about to die for sure
She walk with me through the fire
And love is all she require
She in the arms of a lion
Running 'round with dem shottas
Rode out to meet the boss, introduced her to ragga
She won't end up pay the cots
Her heart is all I desire
We've made it through every storm
I see the tears on your face
Don't you weep, no baby
All this love is not in vain
I'll shelter you through the rain
The mis-takes that I made
Left us, both feeling pain
And the lion roars, when she cries
Crying like.. ooh, ooh..
And the lion roars, when she cries
I'm talking 'bout love, that's my favourite topic
Open up your heart, and let nothing stop it
Even though I try, sometimes I hide the pain
I was born in love, is running through my veins
So I showed love, I gave it all away
This is the only law, that we must obey
As tears fall, from the clouds above
While the angels sing, I give dem all my love
I see the tears on your face
Don't you weep, no baby
All this love is not in vain
I'll shelter you through the rain
The mis-takes that I made
Left us, both feeling pain
And the lion roars, when she cries
Crying like.. ooh, ooh..
And the lion roars, when she cries
I've got a lion's pride
He's got a fragile heart
I live a lion's life
She doesn't know that part
Come [?]
She's giving all she's got
Seems we've grown apart
Still we're all we've got
I see the tears on your face
Don't you weep, no baby
All this love is not in vain
I'll shelter you through the rain
The mis-takes that I made
Left us, both feeling pain
And the lion roars, when she cries
Crying like.. ooh, ooh..
And the lion roars, when she cries
Crying like..

A your youth you know! Wew!
[Chorus]
For the master has come back
Gong the originally
Run for the grand finale mi inna mi Clarky-Wally
For the master has come back
Man! I do it regularly through every hill and valley
It's normal for me now
For the master has come back 
It's Mr. Warm and Easy
She coulda never leave me
Somebody please believe me
For the master has come back
I'm mad wit it
[Verse 1]
BOOM!
We learn from the old school
When strictly thugs used to run it
When one wheel wheely was the move
Long before Bogle start dance and still deh pon paper money
Police ah lock up man fi dem shoes
That simply mean the station full up a bear Clark boot and Bally
From England whe' spankin' new
Before man start to mek flex
When dem used to mek dally
And speak of the rights and truth
If unno starvin' fi di brain food Man have it fi feed you like porridge
Weh rich inna dreadnut juice
Cause nuff a wah dem learn in university and college
It water down and dilute
I tell you street smarts wi carry you through life like a carriage
From a survival point of view
And if what you seek is the truth
And to increase knowledge
Now you surely can't lose...Why?
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
The return of the jedi I when I get back the entire Empire will start to strike back
Well a bare army green full up mi flight pack
Some red eye guy a wonder which bank we hijack
And a we the voluptuous girls a smile at
Any bwoy nuh like dat, him gone pon ice box
We can be dangerous like how the night black
We will dip and come up, select and slide back
And say she loves my culture, herbs and locks
Silkly smooth way of I flow
My words and my tracks
She's hoping we can spend a night at
Somewhere that's warm and cozy...why not
She's been wanting me since my Karl Kani drop
And she needs the substance, not the hype chat
For dark clouds do bring rain...baby
Here comes the sun to shine again
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
BOOM!
I know you're loving the goods that i'm delivering 
Up in your neck of the woods so you can live again
Who is the cock in the coupe which part the chicken in
And dem copy the books that I have written in
And when you hear from the shout
Dem no have no discipline
And dem a run up dem mouth
Them never listening
And when the Gong no deh bout
I know you're missing him
Cause lyrically no doubt i'm nitroglycerin
Mi touch down it's carousels of luggages
My flip phone, my car cell, my messages
My girl bring me parcels and packages
Marijuana cigar smells in palaces
A few coil must pop off for di charities
Cause politician a palave' pon dem promises
A new face will fulfill the prophecies
It's too late for two faced apologies
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
When the fire tun down low we're only simmering
Anyhow we start get cold
Dem would be shivering
Not everything is gold because of glittering
Tell dem fi clean dem soul from all di littering
And they don't own di throne dat they be sitting in
And it was just a loan they're only sitting in
And when the king come home well what a bitter thing
Nashing of teeth and moaning upon bickering
Well mind you catch the flow it can be sickening
Only a few are chosen for the reckoning
It's Rastafari's world that unno living in
And it's a lion's jungle unno visiting
I know you've seen the posters of my images
Upon your streets and close to all your villages
My metaphors unfolding with my similies 
Woman can go dance again
BOOM!
For the master has come back! [x4]

A youth and youth fi have a plan and have some ambition
And make sure unnu firm ina di Armageddon
So when you son become a man, him know just where you stand
Him know him poopa set it so him follow tradition
If Marcus Garvey say fi read then why some man ah pree
Cause knowledge ah the key and it wll set the people free
And Haile I philosophy is African unity
Unno watch dey segregation and social impurity
The race is not just for the swift but those who can endure
Make sure you have a steady footing in ah zion door
And keep dem thoughts dem pure, Jah love is for the poor
But some likkkle bwoy ah burst some gun dem mooma can't afford
If Jah say blood fi run let Jah will be done
The heaven and the earth will pass away before him word no come
But if 'I'm rise without a cause there will be no reward
For you to enter Zion gates because you are a fraud
[Chorus:]
For the youths in the struggle
Fighting Guerilla warfare

From Egypt to Zimbabwe
[Verse 2:]
Haile Selassie say ah war if colour is a scar
If one from every nation can come live up an ah par
So don't care who you are there's a brighter morning star
It's shining with di town and tell the people near and far
You seek and you will search with science and research
The flesh it is the temple and the temple is the church
Haile Selassie say fi work so how some man ah lurks
Dem fix upon the cornerside like rubbish heap and dirt
Haile Selassie say ah one respect for every man
No care dey race, no care dey colour nor di religion
So make a decision fi bun di division
Cause each and every rasta youth to trot pon di mission

From Jungle to Rema
From Tivoli to Matthews Lane
From Southside to Telaville
From Iraq to USA
From Waterhouse to Drewsland

It started as a joke
I never thought it would come to this
Today I'm walking in the bushes, like a criminal
Today I'm walking so slow, like a predator
Just to get a glimpse of you
As you play in the playground
Your mother spoke to the lawyers
Told them I was not good around you
The lawyers spoke to the judges
Told them I was not good around you
The judges gave your mother a letter
That is keeping me away from you
Don't worry, you are never far from me
Inside my heart, I keep a little box
It is the box of memories I created about you
Inside my heart, I keep a little box
It is the box of memories I created about you
[Chorus ×7:]
You are the one, you are the one
Whenever I miss you bad
I walk around the park
Looking at little boys and girls
They remind me of you
There's a lot of stories I'd like to share with you
There's a lot of games, I would like to play with you
Tears come down my face
When I think about what happened
The lawyer spoke to the judges
Told them I was not good around you
The judges gave your mother a letter
That is keeping me away from you
Don't worry, you are never far from me
Inside my heart I keep a little box
It is a box of memories I created about you
[Chorus: till fade]
You are the one, you are the one

His name is Jackson
He lives in Jamaica
Every morning he comes down to the docks to watch the ships come and go
He's been here too long
Mental slavery has not touched him one bit
He still knows his history, he knows where he comes from
That is why he believes the ocean can give him some answers
About the very very far home
That he's never been to. All his life he says
I wish I was home, I wish I was in Africa
I wish I was home, I wish I was in Africa
I have seen his world
I've seen the other world. I have nothing to say
I put my coat on my shoulders
As I walked away, I heard myself sing
The grass is greener on the other side
Til you get there and see it for yourself
The grass is greener on the other side
Til you get there and see it for yourself
The grass is greener on the other side
Til you get there and see it for yourself
His name is Themba
He lives in Soweto
Every morning he goes to the airport to watch the planes come and go
He has changed his African name to a western one
Cause he doesn't know how it hurts to have a name
You can't be proud of. He hopes that one day
One of these birds of the sky can take him away
To a very very far land
Running away from the very roots
That so many black people in the world
Are wanting to come back to. A place they call home
They wish they were home
They wish they were in Africa
They wish they were in Africa
I live in his world, I've seen the other world
I got nothing to say
I put my coat on my shoulders
As I walked away, I heard myself sing
The grass is greener on the other side
Til you get there and see it for yourself
The grass is greener on the other side
Til you get there and see it for yourself
The grass is greener on the other side
Til you get there and see it for yourself

[Chorus:]
Gotta find a solution to this pollution [x4]
The poor man a feel it [x4]
Gas gone up
Bus fare gone up
The rent gone up
For meal gone up?
Lighting gone up
The tax gone up
Car parts gone up
And mi can't take the first law
[Chorus]
Only him feel it - yeah
Time gone up
Scallion gone up
Onion gone up
Red beans gone up
Black pepper gone up
Chicken gone up
And the parents them angry
Cause the pickney them hungry
[Chorus]

Got to, got to, got to, got to
Kneeling, oh kneeling
Oh, kneeling, oh, kneeling under ever loving ways
[?]
Kneeling, ooh kneeling
Oh, kneeling, oh, kneeling, kneeling under ever loving ways
Feel I'm going to lose, lose my mind
Like I'm going to cry right now
Feel I'm going to lose, lose my mind
Feel I'm going to cry, cry right now
And he said, "Sister
You better come fall down on your knees and pray for all your sins"
And he said, "Brother
You know you're fitting for thy kingdom"
Just like when Joshua commanded stood still
He didn't, stood still
And I said "Father
Please, please, please have mercy upon me"
'Cause I got to, got to, got to
Kneeling, ooh kneeling
Ooh, oh kneeling, kneeling under ever loving ways
Everybody sing the song
Kneeling, oh, oh kneeling
And God said, let there be light, oh yeah
And God divided the dark from the light
And the light He called day
And the darkness He called night
So the evening and the morning was the first day
God created the heaven, sand and earth
And this earth was without form and void
'Cause I got to, got to, got to
Kneeling, ooh, oh kneeling
Oh, kneeling, oh kneeling, kneeling under ever loving ways

Yes
The promise land
Going to the promise land
Yes the promise land
Oh gosh now, through the promise land
Imagine Ghana like California with Sunset Boulevard
Johannesburg would be Miami
Somalia like New York
With the most pretty light
The nuffest pretty car
Ever New Year the African Times Square lock-off
Imagine Lagos like Las Vegas
The ballers dem a ball
Angola like Atlanta
A pure plane take off
Bush Gardens inna Mali
Chicago inna Chad
Magic Kingdom inna Egypt
Philadelphia in Sudan
The Congo like Colorado
Fort Knox inna Gabon
People living in Morocco like the state of Oregon
Algeria warmer than Arizona bring your sun lotion
Early morning class of Yoga on the beach in Senegal
Ethiopia the capital of fi di Congression
A deh so I belong
A deh di The King come from
I can see us all in limos
Jaguars and B'mos
Riding on the King's Highway
To the promise land
Going to the promise land
Oh gosh the promise land
Yeah through the promise land
Promised Land I picture Porsche's
Basquiat Portraits
Pinky Rings realistic princesses
Heiresses bunch a Kings and Queens
Plus I picture fortunes for kids out in Port-Au-Prince
Powerless they not allowed to fit
But not about to slip
Vision Promised Land with fashion like
Madison Ave Manhattan
Saks 5th Ave and
Rodeo
Relaxing popping labels
Promise land no fables
This where the truth's told
Use them two holes
Above your nose
To see the proof yo!
Imagine a contraption that could take us back when
The world was run by black men
Back to the future
Anything can happen
If these are the last days
And hundred-foot waves come crashing down
I get some hash and pounds
Pass around the bud then watch the flood
Can't stop apocalypse
My synopsis is catastrophic
If satellites is causing earthquakes
Will we survive it
Honestly man it's the sign of the times
And the times at hand
There's a lot of work to be done, oh gosh
In the promised land
Talking 'bout promise land
Oh gosh get me to the promise land
The promise land oh the promise land
The promise land
There's plenty of land for you and I
By and by
Lost of food, to share for everyone
Cause that was civilization in the promise land
Answer to the promise land
The promise land
Going to the promise land
There's a lot of work to be done
In the promise land

Little boys and girls
Come out and play
The world is a stage
For me and you to play on
We all are actors
We all are actresses
Do you wanna sit around
Watch your life going by
When you can be anything that you wanna be
And you can do anything that you wanna do
Come on... don't let it happen to you
[Chorus:]
The show goes on without you
Forget about your Mama
Forget about your Daddy
They have been to the stage
It's time for them to move on
You are the star of the show now
Controlling your own destiny
Everybody's watching
There's no one to blame
When you can be anything that you wanna be
And you can do anything that you wanna do
Come on... do you wanna sit around
And watch your life go by
[Chorus:]
The show goes on without you

Yo, how it look down there?
The storm is coming, are you ready?
And how it look out there?
The storm is coming, get ready
Yo, how you look out there?
The storm is coming, are you ready?
And how it look down there?
The storm is coming, be ready
Brother, it's a big one
Still you just can't run

So you got to stay
Rebel inna disguise
Must find a way

Yo, how it look down there?
The storm is coming, are you ready?
And how it look out there?
The storm is coming, get ready
Yo, how you look out there (how you look out there)?
The storm is coming, are you ready?
And how it look down there (how it look down there)?
The storm is coming, be ready
Sister, it's a warning
And the eye is a-coming
Helping out your neighbour
Good God, do me a favour
Destroying all the trees
With your money disease
Causing worldwide grief
Oh, the earth need a relief
This might be if it's based on reality
You can't turn to the past, can't change your own history (cho)
The future is in my today, not my tomorrow
That's why when I grab up my pen to paper and write away the stars
You see, people can't live on promises and wishful thinking
You see, to the collective consciousness is whom I'm speaking
You see, this is a message to the world I live in
You see, you see, you see, you see
Rebel inna disguise
Oh, must find a way
Harambe
A me say Harambe
Yo, how it look down there (how it look down there)?
The storm is coming, are you ready?
And how it look out there (how it look out there)?
The storm is coming, get ready
Yo, how you look out there (how you look out there)?
The storm is coming, are you ready?
And how it look down there (how it look down there)?
The storm is coming, be ready
How it look out there?
The storm is coming, are you ready?
The storm is coming, get ready
The storm is coming, are you ready?
The storm is coming, be ready
How it look down there (how it look down there)?
The storm is coming, are you ready?
Roll up my window (how it look out there?)
(The storm is coming, get ready)
Secure my door (how it look out there?)
(The storm is coming, are you ready?)
Suriprise in store (how it look down there?)
(The storm is coming, be ready)

Jah!
His Imperial Majesty
Has been so gracious and so kind
To alleviate the misery
And free the shackles from our minds
Throughout the pages of history
Nothing done, if nothing tried
After all, Rome was not built overnight
No, oh

No, no, no, no, no, no
(No more struggle)
No, no, no, no, no, no
(No more struggle)
No, no, no, no, no, no

Prosperity from now on
And I don' wanna sing a song that says

When I wish it would die and wither away
No more struggling at all
Well, if the struggle continue then
When will we overcome?
Right here and now my struggling end
Prosperity from now on

Didn't I raise my voice
High enough for you
I was running like a fugitive all the time
Risking rejection from my own people yeah
Now that you got what you wanted
You don't even know my name
It's so funny, we don't talk anymore
Be good to the people on your
Way up the ladder
Cause you'll need them on your way down
[Chorus:]
That's the way it is
Didn't I raise my fists high enough for you
I guess I can't pat myself on the shoulder
For a job well done
Dodging bullets in the streets
I was there
Risking rejection from my own people
Now that you got what you wanted
You don't even know my name
Remember
Be good to the people on your way
Up the ladder 'cause you'll need
Them on your way down
[Chorus:]
That's the way it is

Na-na na na-na na na na;
Na-na na na-na na na na;
Na-na na na-na na na na;

Them belly full, but we hungry;
A hungry mob is a angry mob.
A rain a-fall, but the dutty tough;
A yot a-yook, but d' yood no 'nough.
You're gonna dance to Jah music, dance;
We're gonna dance to Jah music, dance, oh-ooh!
Forget your troubles and dance!
Forget your sorrows and dance!
Forget your sickness and dance!
Forget your weakness and dance!
Cost of livin' gets so high,
Rich and poor they start to cry:
Now the weak must get strong;
They say, "Oh, what a tribulation!"
Them belly full, but we hungry;
A hungry mob is a angry mob.
A rain a-fall, but the dutty tough;
A pot a-yook, but d' yood* no 'nough.
We're gonna chuck to Jah music - chuckin';
We're chuckin' to Jah music - we're chuckin'.
A belly full, but them hungry;
A hungry mob is a angry mob.
A rain a-fall, but the dutty tough;
A pot a-cook, but d' food* no 'nough.
A hungry man is a angry man;
A rain a-fall, but the dutty tough;
A pot a-yook, but you no 'nough'
A rain a-fall, but the dutty tough.
A pot a-cook, but you no 'nough;
A hungry mob is a angry mob;
A hungry mob is a angry mob. /fadeout/

[Verse 1]
Hey!
Vexation of spirit is a waste of time
Negative thinking, don't you waste your thoughts
Verbal conflict is a waste of word
Physical conflict is a waste of flesh
People will always be who they want
And that's what really makes the world go round
Unconditional love is scarce
("Till shiloh I shall not forsake thee")
Now and forever more
Forever more, forever more...
YEAH!
[Chorus]
You see, you gave precious life to me
So I live my life for you...You...
You see, you've always been there for me
And so i'll be there for you...You...
("Till shiloh I shall not forsake thee")
[Verse 2]
Bless your eyes and may your days be long
May you rise on the morning when His kingdom come
Good deeds aren't remembered in the hearts of men
(.....Oooooooh)
Bless your eyes and may your dreams come true
May you rise on the morning when Jah kingdom come
Good deeds aren't remembered in the hearts of men 
("Till shiloh I shall not forsake thee")
Now and forever more
Forever more...
[Chorus]
You see, you've always had faith in me
And so i'll have faith in you...You...
You've always been there for me
And so i'll be there for you...You...
Hey!
You've always been good to me
Even when i'm not good to myself
You've always been fair to me
Even when i'm not fair to myself
You've always done right by me
So I will do right by you...You...
("Till shiloh I shall not forsake thee")
You've always been there for me, mama
So i'll be there for you, papa
You've always been fair to me, brother
And so i'll be fair to you, sister
You've always had faith in me
And so i'll have faith in you...You..
You've always been good to me
You've always been to kind to me
You've always stood up for me
You've always been there for me
You've always been...oooooh
You've always been...oooooh
You always did care for me...yeh
You always did share with me...yeh
You always been true to me
And so i'll be true to you...

Oh, the truth hurts now, more than the lie
Tell you the truth, now I'm blamed to be wrong
I wear no disguise
But I trod on through those memories
That haunt me, that haunt me
I trod on through those memories
That haunt me oh man that haunt me
There she goes crying again
But her loveliness won't cover her shame
And there she goes, taking true love
While she's taking true love, she's given the blame
How could I be so wrong
To think that we could get along
Days I've spent wasted with you child
If I count they'd be a million or two
But I walk on through that memory
That haunts me oh man that haunts me
I say I trod on through that angry grief
That taunt me, that taunts me
There she goes crying again
But her sexiness won't cover her shame
And there she goes she's taking her true love
But while she's taking true love, she's given the blame
How, how, how could I be so wrong
To think that we could work out
Days I've spent wasted with you child
If I could count they'd be a million or two
Now I walk on through that rocky reef
That wants me and that wanted me
Woman I walk on through that angry grief
That taunts me, I say that taunts me
Oh, the truth hurts now, more than the lie, lie
I tell you the truth, now I'm blamed to be
Wrong I wear no disguise, no I
There she goes crying again
But her loveliness won't cover her shame
And there she goes, she's taking her true love
While she's taking true love, she's given the blame
How could I be so dumb
To think that we could have some fun
Days I've wasted with you child
If I count, they'd be a million or two
Now I walk on through those memories
That wants me oh man that wants me
I said I trod on through that angry grief
That taunts me I know it taunts me
There she goes crying again
But her sweet caress won't cover her shame
And there she goes, she's taking true love
While she's taking true love, she's given the blame
How could I be so wrong
To think that we could work out
Why should I be so dumb
To think that we could have some fun
There she goes crying again
There she goes crying again

There she goes
With the pieces from my heart
There she goes
And now my teardrop starts
And here I go, once again
Through these lonely
Heartaches and pain
That's all remain
All remain
Now I know
Love is a guessing game
And she goes
With the pieces from my heart
There she goes
And now my teardrop starts
Who's gonna put back
The pieces
To my broken heart
Once again, once again
Now I know
This could be the end
And she gone
With the pieces from my heart
There she goes
And now my teardrop start
And here I go once again
Through these lonely
Heartaches and pain
That's all remain
Now I know
This could be the end
And she gone...

It's not everyday we're gonna be the same way
There must be a change somehow
There are bad times and good times too
So have a little faith in what you do, 'cause
You don't seem to realise
The things you've got to face in life
Today you're up, tomorrow you're down
So thank god that you're still around town
Though we've got to work like slaves
Just to eat a piece of bread
But as we go along each day we'll find
Happiness to sooth our mind cause
It's not everyday we're gonna be the same way
There must be a change somehow
There are bad times and good times too
So have a little faith in what you do

The parents are the people we're depending on
For the growth of the children
If they treat them right
We gonna have a brighter future
If they treat them wrong
We gonna have brats in the world
If they grow up without the parents
Who's gonna tell them this is right
If they grow up without the parents
Who's gonna tell them this is wrong
You've got to fast your while
Just think about the children
If they grow up without the parents
Who's gonna tell them this is right
Without the mother, children are suffering
Without the father, children are suffering
Without the parents, children are suffering
Born to suffer, born to suffer
Born to suffer, born to suffer
Born to suffer, born to suffer
Born to suffer, born to suffer
Born to suffer, born to suffer
You've got to watch out my son
If your mother doesn't care for you
You've got to watch out my girl
If your mother doesn't care for you
Kwashiorkor is there
It's gonna attack 'em
They need parental care
They need spiritual care
If they grow up without the parents
Who's gonna tell them this is right
If they grow up without the parents
Who's gonna tell them this is wrong
They need parental care
They need spiritual care
If they grow up without the parents
Who's gonna tell them this is wrong
Without the mother, children are suffering
Without the father, children are suffering
Without the parents

History been renamed
Time have no friend
Who you a go warn, when the real war come on
A no we you have to warn when the truth bust out
Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one...
Malcolm X, Garvey, Martin, Marley, Mohammed, Yesus Christ
Strive and free your life
Don't play their games
Don't put your mind to waste, don't put your mind to waste
Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one
This is the one that is this one
Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one
This is the one that is this one
Propaganda machine working overtime
Now more than ever on the younger minds
Don't just believe everything you see on the TV
Don't just believe everything you read in the magazine
Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one
This is the one that is this one
Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one
This is the one that is this one
People have their place
Race has its pace
Each blow a the right one
Every blow carries a weight
No giving up in I, I will keep the faith
No giving up in I, fight them racist hate
No no no no no no no no you can't do nothing 'bout it
You can't do nothing 'bout it
Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one
This is the one that is this one
Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one
I am the one that is this one
We are the one that is this one
Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one
Dem can't do nothing 'bout this one
This is the one that is this one
It a the right one, it a the real one...

[Stephen Marley:]
We come from so far, and life is full of surprises
Just know I'll never change, no I’ll never change
No matter the circumstances, though this road can be demanding
I’ll always be the same, always be the same
Never lose sight of who you are, temptation comes from near and far
Wounds heal but leave a scar
Make sure from the start, its from your heart
[Chorus:]
Because didn’t you know, that the higher you go
It’s the more you'll expose, if you’re a thorn or a rose
Because didn’t you know, that the higher you go
It’s the more you'll expose, if you’re a thorn or a rose
[Black Thought:]
Yo
We're all products of the same stem, same blood, and same skin
Same ghetto flower growing from the same pavement
Rising to the challenge of this world and trying to stay in it
Paying tears and sweat, paying dues and paying rent
Never shall I stumble I stay on the same wavelength
Yeah the game is savage yo it’s primitive its cavemen
Only way to save men and free them from enslavement
Start to over stand each other like a native language
Guiding one another down this road full of changes
Although its full of dangers we got to be courageous
Let the vibes spread and make your bravery contagious
Know you’re going through the same book but different pages
People can be so vain, hustling can be so pain-ful
And make you feel like all you do is work for no gain
But before it bottles up the flames like propane
Inhale and exhale, no stress and no strain
[Chorus]
[Stephen Marley:]
We come from so far, and life is full of surprises
Just know I'll never change, no I’ll never change
No matter the circumstances, though this road can be demanding
I’ll always be the same, always be the same
Never lose sight of who you are, temptation comes from near and far
Wounds heal but leave a scar
Make sure from the start, its from your heart
[Chorus]

I can still remember
When we were much younger
Skies were blue and fields were green
oh the air’s so clean
Animals ran wild and free
birds could sing in harmony
flowers would grow all around
and Mother Earth was sound
[CHORUS]
In those good good old days
In those good good old days
In those good good old days
That used to be
Where did all the green fields go
And flowers now that just won’t grow
Animals are dying out
That lives north and south
They found out how to crack the skies
Casting shadows on our eyes
Telling us just how to live
And when to die 
[CHORUS]
But those good good old days
yes those good good old days
In those good good old days
That used to be
Wasting oil upon the sea
That used to be so fresh and free
Poisoned gases everywhere
Stifling the air
And many children lose their way
By leaders of confusion
And leave them with the price to pay 
Of hastened evolution 
[CHORUS]
But those good good old days
In those good good old days
yes those good good old days
That used to be
Talking ‘bout those good old days
Talking ‘bout those good old good old days
Don’t you remember
Try to remember
I’m sure you know
I’m sure you know

Lion dem never yet grudge the other creatures of the forest.
What you reap is what you sow, don't be surprised when we a harvest

We take a lot of things for granted
One day it'll be taken away
That's when you'll realize
How important it was
You never miss your water
Till your well runs dry
Give thanks and praise all the time
The wolf is always by the door
[Chorus:]
You don't know what you've got
Till you lose it all again
You never miss your water
Till your well runs dry
He's a hero, now that he's dead
Oh what a bull preacherman talks about him
When he was alive
He didn't even know his name
When he was alive
He didn't get this love
You never miss your water
Till your well runs dry
[Chorus:]
You don't know what you've got
Till you lose it again
You never lose your water
Till your well runs dry

You said you loved me
and then you left
you broke every promise
you win every bet
[Chorus:]
you never miss your water
till your well runs dry
so tell me tell me

Listen to me darlin'

[Chorus]
Sat down and sighed
and I heard you packin
I watched you pass by me
but you said nothin'
not one single word but I know

and you're gonna be blue
[Chorus]

I go to bed but sleep won't come
Get up in the night
I couldn't fight my feelings
Early in the morning
It's just the same situation
Here comes the landlord just a knocking upon my door
You knockin' upon my door
I've got four hundred/month rent to pay
And I can't find a job
Let me tell you time tough (Time Tough)
Everything is out of sight, it's so hard (So hard)
Time tough (Time Tough)
Everything is growing higher and higher
Sister Lee cannot bear it
And brother Lincoln hardly stand it now
They're crying night and day, louder and louder
Nobody to help them make their way
I've got four hundred/month rent to pay
And I can't find a dollar
Let me tell you time tough (Time Tough)
Everything is out of sight, it's so hard (So hard)
Time hard (Time hard)
Everything is growing higher and higher
Good times was leading the bad times
But now the bad times take over
When I was a little boy
I just keep on feeling it, feeling it, feeling it
Feeling it, wow get down
Eh, eh, eh
Time tough (Time Tough)
Everything is out of sight, it's so hard (So hard)
Time tough (Time Tough)
Everything is growing higher and higher
Can't blame the minister
And you can't blame the preacher
And you can't blame your brother
And you cannot blame your sister
Can't blame your friends
'Cause today is the judgement day
And that's why everyone have to pray
Let me tell you time tough (Time Tough)
Everything is out of sight, it's so hard (So hard)
Time tough (Time Tough)
Everything is growing higher and higher...

Moonwalking, time travel
New day, more truth unravel
Mars landing, space gravel
Mankind still a fight and squabble
iPod, King James Bible
Slingshot onto long cal. rifle
Tower of Babel, Tower of Eiffel
Twelve month a year, but thirteen disciple
Saddam, Bin Laden, Gaddafi, Idi Amin
Call Of Duty, drone bombin'
Stealth bomber, more famine
Biometrics, eye scannin'
Airport body search and swabbing
More police harassment and naggin'
More stick-up and random bank robbin'
Sufferation, plus swagging
Equal one big conflict we're having
Chain grabba, hijackin'
Nowadays is computer hackin'
ID thief and credit card scammin'
Social network, blogging an spammin'
Hi-def TV, surround sound pannin'
Next generation, FIFA and Madden
More problem, more panic
Suddenly now more planet
More places man can inhabit
Colonize and breed up like rabbit
Contaminate and spread dirty habit
Cross-populate and thief them knowledge
I said it right back in the college
Meanwhile we call 'em savage
What will the future bring for me?
'Cause global warming feels so cold
What will the future bring?
What will the future bring?
What will the future bring for me?
If my little son is seven years old
What will the future bring for him?
What will the future bring?
What's real life?
What's virtual?
What's fiction?
What's factual?
Who's partial?
Who's neutral?
What's not real?
What's natural?
Who's actin'?
Who's actual?
What's cheap talk?
What's action?
What's ours?
What's fraction?
What's plus or subtraction?
Aquarius, then Pisces
Al Qaeda, then ISIS
Stock markets in crisis
Government raise tax and prices
Countless warships on the high seas
Gang war and the streets full of sirens
Like Wi-Fi at the high speed
Shot a shell, like grains of rices
Mother bawl, I beg them why please
Man a fall, head a roll like lychees
One and all, get cold like night breeze
Man at arms
What will the future bring?
If half of the animals face extinction
What will the future bring for us?
What will the future bring?
What will the future bring?
No more ancient scrolls to give direction
What will the future bring for me?
What will the future bring?

Time will tell, time will tell
Time alone will tell
When I was just a little boy only six years old
I asked my daddy what big things my future hold
He said, Son, when you grow up to be a man,
The facts of life you will start to understand
Nobody knows just what tomorrow may bring
So I want to tell you now, and listen while I sing
Father said,
Time will tell, time will tell
Time alone will tell
Now I'm a lonely man trying to make life on my own
Ever since the day I was born, I never have a happy home
Just like the river, I've been running ever since
The day I was born in that broken down little town
I'm wondering now just what my gain will be
'Cause it seems to me, happiness I'll never see
Mama said,
Time will tell, time will tell
Time alone will tell
What he say now,
Time will tell, time will tell
Time alone will tell
Time keeps on changing like the weather and the seasons
For every mistake, Mama said, there must be a reason
After a storm, there's got to be a calm
So I think I'll wait a while and try to wear a smile (Wear a smile)
Mama said,
Time will tell, time will tell
Time alone will tell
What he say now,
Time will tell - I know, I know!
Time will tell - said I know
Time alone will tell
One more time now
Time will tell - I believe
Time will tell - oh yes, I do!
Time alone will tell - I believe that...

Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-hm! Ooh-oo-oo-oo-er. Mm-mm-mm.
Jah would never give the power to a baldhead
Run come crucify the Dread.
Time alone - oh, time will tell:
Think you're in heaven, but ya living in hell;
Think you're in heaven, but ya living in hell;
Think you're in heaven, but ya living in hell.
Time alone - oh, time will tell:
Ya think you're in heaven, but ya living in hell.
Back them up; oh, not the brothers,
But the ones who sets 'em up.
Time alone - oh, time will tell:
Think you're in heaven, but ya living in hell;
Think you're in heaven, but ya living in hell;
Think you're in heaven, but ya living in hell.
Time alone - oh, time will tell:
Ya think you're in heaven, but ya living in hell.
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
Oh, ma ...................
Oh, ma ...................
Oh, ma children are cryin'.
Oh, children, weep no more!
Oh, ma sycamore tree, saw the freedom tree.
All you ... have spoke:
Oh, children, weep no more;
Weep no more: children, weep no more!
Jah would never give the power to a baldhead
Run come crucify the Dread.
Time alone - oh, time will tell:
Think you're in heaven, but ya living in hell;
Think you're in heaven, but ya living in hell;
Think you're in heaven, but ya living in hell.
Time alone - oh, time will tell:
Think you're in heaven, but ya living in hell.

Ooh yeah, oh I said

We just tryna live while the night's young
Too focused on the right now to worry 'bout what might come
All the stressing lately got me thinking I should light some
All that playing baby, light one
Busy Iggy, pretty girl stacking up pretty pennies
Save this chitter-chatter, ain't never mattered
It don't offend me
Say they shocked I bring is money with me, then take over cities
Turn a hard-top to a soft-top, had a re-do for them titties
Every eye on my hip and waistline, watch me whine
And they must have forgotten about me baby, let me remind dem
Everyone's a critic nowadays, never mind dem
We bring the stars out and realign dem
[Stephen Marley:]
So tonight we gon' have a good time
Yes tonight, we gon' celebrate life
Oh tonight, we gon' have a party

[Waka Flocka Flame:]
It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
I'm getting kush, taking shots, get it started
They like, "Did you hear that song with Flocka and Stephen Marley?"
I'm doing donuts in the parking lot in my Ferrari
I love my people, I do this for my people
See the evil, why we need to be illegal?
And hella reefer and wake up to the reaper
Take a leap of faith, lose the hate and love your people
I make beats and smoking doobies chillin in Jamaica
Cross me and I'mma introduce you to your maker
I can't hear these suckers scheming, I know they some haters
You can copy the machine or make the paper
Or you could be original, reach pinnacle
Alcohol and kush, that's my vitamins and minerals
Chilling with my girl, skinny dipping in the swimming pool

[Stephen Marley:]
So tonight we gon' have a good time
Yes tonight, we gon' celebrate life
Oh tonight, we gon' have a party
Yes tonight, everyone is right
If even just tonight

She doesn't want me... around 
She's got  something to hide 
I think she want's a clown, someone to take for a ride...
What I keep telling her, 
I'm too experienced to be taken for a stroll...
too experienced for someone to rock and roll,
I'm too experienced to be taken for a ride,
and I know its not my foolish pride... 
She hates the site...
of me because I turned her offer down 
She's always saying we were meant to be 
Somehow she thought I'd be her clown 
And this is what I sing: 
I'm too experienced to be taken for a stroll...
to experienced for someone to rock and roll,
I'm too experienced to be taken for a ride,
and I know it's not my foolish pride 
She doesn't want me around 
she got's something to hide,
I think she wants a clown,
someone to take for a ride,
this is what I sing 
I'm too experienced to be taken for a stroll...
to experienced for someone to rock and roll,
I'm too experienced to be taken for a ride,
and I know it's not my foolish pride

Many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering I am lost
As I travel along the white cliffs of dover
Many rivers to cross
And it's only my will that keeps me alive
I've been licked, washed up for years
And I merely survive because of my pride
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be on your own
My woman left me and she didn't say why
Well, I guess I'll have to cry
Many rivers to cross
But just where to begin I'm playing for time
There have been times I find myself
Thinking of committing some dreadful crime
Yes, I've got many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering, I am lost
As I travel along the white cliffs of Dover
Yes, I've got many rivers to cross
And I merely survive because of my will...

They don't want to see us unite:
All they want us to do is keep on fussing and fighting.
They don't want to see us live together:

They say the blood runs;
And it runs through our line,
And our hearts, heart of hearts divine, eh!
And John saw them comin', ooh! - a-with the truth
From an ancient time.
The brotherly love (brotherly love), the sisterly love (sisterly love)
I feel this morning; I feel this morning:
Brotherly love (brotherly love), the sisterly love (sisterly love)
I feel this morning, this morning. Hey!

Touch me
Every minute, please touch me
Oh I see you pass my way again
And your call, call yourself my friend
Well let me tell you what's good to be
It's no no more than your love cannot be
So touch me said I ride on
Just a ride oh as I'm riding I'll be, o yeah
Oh I see you pass my way again
And your call, call yourself my friend
Well let me tell you what's good to be
We two cannot walk unless we agree
So touch me
Every minute

Have you ever seen a dream walking?
Have you ever heard a dream talking?
You are the master of your dreams
If you pull the right strings
It could be talking to you
If you pull the right strings
It could be walking to you.
You are the one to make it happen
You're the only one that knows what is
You are holding the key to your dreams
Don't hesitate grab the chance
Before it's too late.
[Chorus:]
Reach out and touch your dreams.
Don't let them tell you it is impossible
That is what they told all heroes before
In a hero's mind the word does not exist
When you're 80 years old
Thinking about your past
Regretting every minute of your life
That you've lost
You will wonder where the time went
If you do the right thing
It could be talking to you
Don't hesitate, grab the chance
Before it's too late.
[Chorus:]
Reach out and touch your drea.

You want me to leave, you want me to stay

(Scoop, scoop, scoop, scoo-doo;
Scoop, scoop wa-doo.)
Up a cane river to wash my dread;
Upon a rock I rest my head.
There I vision through the seas of oppression, oh-oo-wo!
Don't make my life a prison.
We come from Trench Town, Trench Town (Trenchtown) -
Most of them come from Trench Town.
We free the people with music (sweet music);
Can we free the people with music (sweet music)?
Can we free our people with music? - With music,
With music, oh music!
Oh-y, my head,
In desolate places we'll find our bread,
And everyone see what's taking place, oh-oo-wo! -
Another page in history.
We come from Trench Town,
Come from Trench Town;
We come from Trench Town.
Lord we free the people with music (sweet music);
We free the people with music (sweet music);
We free our people with music,
With music, oh music (oh music)!
They say it's hard to speak;
They feel so strong to say we are weak;
But through the eyes the love of our people, oh-oo-wo!
They've got to repay.
We come from (Trenchtown) Trench Town;
We come from (Trenchtown) Trench Town;
Trench - Trench Town (Trenchtown).
They say, "Can anything good come out of Trench Town?"
(Trench - Trenchtown)
That's what they say, (Trenchtown); (Trench - Trenchtown)
Say (Trench - Trenchtown) we're the underprivileged people,
So (Trenchtown) they keep us in chains:
"Pay (Trench - Trenchtown) - pay - pay tribute to -" (Trenchtown).
We come from (Trench - Trenchtown);
We come from (Trench - Trenchtown);
Just because we come from Trench Town.
Not because we come from Trench Town;
Just because we come from (Trenchtown). [fadeout]

But fools know not of understanding
That's why they stumble
Never going to their way, oh, yeah

I'm sleeping with my one eye open
'Cause I think you gonna come for me
You're sleeping with your gun in hand
'Cause you think I'm gonna make
Me move
I've been chasing white people all my life
You've been chasing black people all
Your life
Now that we know where we went
Wrong, it's time some truth came out here
You going to educate me
About white people
I will educate you about Black people and we'll unite
That's why they call me trinity
And my game is unity
[Chorus:]
Trinity, unity
My brothers have been chasing racists all the time
Your brothers have been chasing freedom fighters all the time
But at the end of the day
We didn't know much about each other yeah
When you saw a black man
You saw a criminal,
When I saw a white man
I saw an oppressor
But now that we know where we went wrong
Let's unite
You will educate me about white people
I will educated you about black people
That is why they call my trinity
Cause my game is unity
[Chorus: till fade]

You say that your love was just for me
And that's why I've got to be yours
You told me the day will never come
When you will walk out on me
'Cause you know that true love is hard to find
Of course you know that true love is hard to find
Just because you know that true love is hard to find
Hard to find
Very hard to find
I say true love, true love, true love, true love, true love is hard to find
You told me that you know I have to travel all over
That you would take care of my business for me
But darling all I ask of you is to leave those business alone
And say your love endures for me
'Cause I know that true love is hard to find
Of course I know that true love is hard to find
I believe true love is hard to find

And know it fills my heart with joy forever and love for you
Darling I always think of you
And always know my heart fills with love for you
'Cause I know that true love is hard to find

Love is a habit
My true true love I found
A love that is bright as the moonlight
A love that so wide as the sun
Sometimes it makes me happy
Sometimes it makes me sorry
Sometimes I wanna get rid of it
The next time, I am rid of it
A love is like a gypsy
The true true true true love I prove
A love that is wide as the ocean
And deep deep deep deep as the sea
True true love

We gave you history,
But what about the true story
Hidiing your heritage
to keep you into bondage
they stole your culutre
to say you got no future

to keep you into subjection
AND THATS THE TRUE STORY
they took the natural living
and gave you articificail living
they took the solcial living
and turned it into socilisim
they took the communl living 
and turned in into communisum
they took the capital living
and turned it into capitialism
AND THATS THE TRUE STORY
my ancestors were kings of old
half the stories have not been told
they were mighty men and women
my children will be  like them
we are the seed of abraham
descneded from adam
we are the true born israleites
the true born ishmaelites
AND THATS THE TRUE STORY
DON'T YOU LIE

Life has come a long way since yesterday I say
And its not the same old thing over again I say
Just do what you feel and don't you fool yourself I say
Cause I can't make you happy unless I am I say I say I
Got to be true to myself got to be true to myself
Day in day out I've asked many questions I say
Only to find the truth it never changes I say
If you don't deal with it it keeps killing you a little by little I say
Call me selfish if you will my life I alone can live I say I say I
Got to be true to myself got to be true to myself
I don't care if it hurts I'm tired of lies and all these games
I've reached a point in life no longer can I be this way
Don't come crying to me I too have shed my share of tears
I'm moving on yes I'm grooving on well I'm finally free I've
Got to be true to myself got to be true to myself
Got to be true to myself got to be true to myself

I've been risking my life all these years
Protecting you from all the wrongs you did, man
I keep all this because of your promises
You promise me that you will die when I die
You promise that when trouble comes my way
You're gonna be there
But'a when'a trouble caz'a nock'a in'a I and I door
You were not there to be found
But when the trouble comes and knocks on my door
You're not there to be found
But when the trouble comes and knocks on my door
You're not there to be found
The world is turning around
Yesterday becomes tomorrow
When lies are said to be the truth
And truth is said to be lies, yeah, yeah, yeah
No truth in this world, no truth in this world
Like a preacher in church
Who preaches until tears run down his face
But when the sun goes down he is the hooligan
But when the sun goes down he is the witch
Now he is doin all this in the Creators name
Do you think this is the way God wants it to be?
The world is turning around
When today becomes tomorrow
When lies are said to be truth
The future becomes the past
No truth in this world, no truth in this world
No truth in this world, no truth in this world
No truth in this world, no truth in this world

I hear some people say love is just a four-letter word today
There's a question I like to ask:
Where would you be without love?
Love is why you're here
Love is why you came here
Universal love

I have know this preacherman
For a long time, he was a good man
I have known this judge
For a long time, he was a good man
I have known this teacher
For a long time, he was a good man too
But because of the drugs
They've been taking secretly
Them are in loony houses today
We cannot stand aside and look
While the nation is going down the drain [x2]
Up with hope, down with dope [x3]
We cannot stand aside and look
While the nation is going down the drain.
We really, really cannot stand aside and look while the nation is going down the drain
Oh Yo
I am telling you now
Cocaine, no good for you
Liquor, no good for you
You go sniffling them glue
No good for you
They give it to you and say it's the sense of knowledge
But I known I've been around
For a while
I cannot stand aside
And look while the nation [x2]
Is going down the drain
Oh yo yo yo

Up with hope, down with dope

I'm gonna use what I got
To get what I need
I'm gonna use what I got, use all I got
To get what I need, yeah
Look, I was born in a little old shack
Didn't have enough to eat
Not enough clothes on my back
Lord knows I kept the faith
A heart full of woe
Now they're trying to get me
At the end of my road
Use what I got
To get what I need
I'm gonna use what I got, use all I got
To get what I need, yeah
The rich is content
While the poor do without
If you ask for some herb
They don't know what you're talking about
All say they answer
As if they're on the wind
It changes sometimes
That why I'm afraid I've gotta
Use what I got 
To get what I need
I'm gonna use what I got, use all I got
To get what I need, yeah
The road of life is mighty steep
When you're broke, busted and disgusted
For you ain't got nowhere to sleep
I'm gonna find me a woman to stand by my side
'Cause I'm so tired of running
Can't find no place to hide
I'm gonna use what I got
To get what I need
I'm gonna use what I got, use all I got
To get what I need, yeah
Use what I got, you know that I got to
Use what I got, said I've got to
Use what I got, you gotta use it
Use what I got, use it all up now
Use what I got, yes I have
Use what I got, I've got to, got to
Use what I got, said I got to
Use what I got

Didn't know she was crying
Until now as she turns to look at me
She said boy o'boy you bring tears to my eyes
I said what, she said
Boy o'boy you bring tears to my eyes
Bob Marley said
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look
But little did he know that
Eventually the enemy
Will stand aside and look
While we slash and kill
Our own brothers
Knowing that already
They are the victims of the situation
Still licking wounds from brutality
Still licking wounds from humiliation
She said all these words and the
Wrinkles on her face became
Perfect trails for the tears and she said;
[Chorus: x3]
We are the victims everytime
We got double trouble everytime
She took me outside to the churchyard
Showed me graves on the ground
And she said;
There lies a man who fought for equality
There lies a boy who died in his struggle
Can all these heroes die in vain
While we slash and kill our own brothers
Knowing that already they are the
Victims of the situation
Still licking wounds from brutality
Still licking wounds from humiliation
[Chorus: till fade]

Walk in love, talk in love
You will ever walk with love
All my life
Woo, your life
Your life and my life will be much longer
If you really walk in love
I don't mind
I try to live my life
While another man try to take his life
I will never, never, never weary yet
I will never walk alone, no
Live in love
Talk in love, whoa
Walk in love

Walk in love, walk in love
Walk in love, walk in love
Walk in love, walk in love
Walk in love, walk in love
Walk in love, walk in love

This is, it's not your ordinary type of love song, matter of fact I mean every word I say
Wait and me show love but my heart is free
Telling me something I mostly agree
This little lesson I'm learning real well, well
Well well well
Pass through the country where we used to live
All of those people, their blessing to give
Trying to give in their truth and right, well
Well well well
And I say, and it's easier to say what hard to do
Good things to one another
Should have done for you
And it's hard to say when it's easy to do
Bad things to one another
Like I did to you
And I saw you walking away
My soul was crying that day
Never knew love was this way
Whoa well well well
And I see you walking away
My heart goes crying each day
Never knew love was this way
Yeah, and then you say
It's so easy to say what hard to do
Good things, good things, good things
I'd love to do for you
It's hard to say when it's easy to do
Bad things, bad things, bad things
I couldn't do to you
Wait and me show love but my heart is free
Telling me something I mostly agree
This little lesson I'm learning real well, well
Well well well
Pass through the country where we used to live
All of those people, their blessing to give
Trying to give in their truth and right, well
Well well well
And I saw you walking away
My soul was crying that day
Never knew love was this way
Whoa well well well
And I see you walking away
My heart goes crying each day
Never knew love was this way

In the valley of decision.

[Chorus:]
Said I'm wanted, dread and alive
By the evil forces
Said I'm wanted, dread and alive
Nowhere to hide
They are trying to find me
Babylon charge I for ganja
Which I know couldn't do
How could one man Gang Jah
Must be an ape from the zoo
[Chorus]
I've been accused for a shootin'
Which I know never do
Who dem in prison that willing dey
So I've got to pull my way through
[Chorus]
Yesterday was court day
And I-Man forget to go
Today my name is in my papers
And next warrant they will show
[Chorus]
Now I've got to
Judge two guns
To protect myself from men
'Cause I've never done nothin' wrong
And I hate traveling scared
[Chorus]

I'm a wanted, wanted man
I'm a wanted, wanted man
I'm on the run...
They say I'm a threat, to their society
'Cause I stand for love and justice, sincerity
The price on my head is getting, higher every day
But I say, oh Lord, thank you, alhamdulillah
They don't know where I stay... and that's why
I'm a wanted, wanted man
I'm a wanted, wanted man
I'm on the run...
I said that I never, never did no wrong
But they wanna cut me down, 'cause I'm strong, strong, strong

So they want to cut me down to get me
Clean out of sight... but they can't, so
I'm a wanted, wanted man
I'm a wanted, wanted man
I'm a wanted, wanted man
I'm a wanted, wanted man
I'm on the run...

'Cause I stand for love and justice, sincerity
Truth is my defense and it's no sin
To some it's an offense that's how I win
And that's how: I'm a wanted, wanted man
Yes I'm a wanted, wanted man, but I stand for what I believe
And what I believe in is truths and rights
Truths and rights, truths and rights

Every where in the world
People are fighting for freedom
Nobody knows what is right
Nobody knows what is wrong
The black man say it's the white man
The white man say it's the black man
Indians say it's the coloureds
Coloureds say it's everyone
Your mother didn't tell you the truth
Cause my father didn't tell me the truth
Nobody knows what is wrong
And what is right

We don't know where it's coming from
And where it's going
So why don't we
I'm not saying this
Because I'm a coward
But I'm thinking of the lives
That we lose everytime we fight
Killing innocent people
Women and children yeah
Who doesn't know about the government
Who doesn't know about the wars
Your mother didn't tell you the truth
Cause my father did not tell me the truth
Yeah
Black man say it's the white man
White man say it's the black man
Indians say it's the coloureds
Coloureds say it's everyone

Until the philosophy which hold one race superior
And another
Inferior
Is finally
And permanently
Discredited
And abandoned -
Everywhere is war -
Me say war.
That until there no longer
First class and second class citizens of any nation
Until the colour of a man's skin
Is of no more significance than the colour of his eyes -
Me say war.
That until the basic human rights
Are equally guaranteed to all,
Without regard to race -
Dis a war.
That until that day
The dream of lasting peace,
World citizenship
Rule of international morality
Will remain in but a fleeting illusion to be pursued,
But never attained -
Now everywhere is war - war.
And until the ignoble and unhappy regimes
that hold our brothers in Angola,
In Mozambique,
South Africa
Sub-human bondage
Have been toppled,
Utterly destroyed -
Well, everywhere is war -
Me say war.
War in the east,
War in the west,
War up north,
War down south -
War - war -
Rumours of war.
And until that day,
The African continent
Will not know peace,
We Africans will fight - we find it necessary -
And we know we shall win
As we are confident
In the victory
Of good over evil -
Good over evil, yeah!
Good over evil -
Good over evil, yeah!
Good over evil -
Good over evil, yeah! [fadeout]

Doing what they think they must
Scenes in black and white
Painted with the brush
So you think they care
It's a paper town
With paper politicians, oh yes
Hey, you think you're safe

'Can't live without it
When the world gets hooked on drugs
You and I are hooked on music
We smoke it

It is your natural way
Of staying high
You see, when you smoke music
You don't have to smoke and hide
Even when policeman comes
You don't have to jump no fence
[Chorus:]
We love it
We smoke it
Never stop the music
Come on and make it your way of life
Even the president agrees
It is your natural connection
To staying high

Never stop the music

Don't check no luggage just carry on

Walk with your head way up above the sky
I'll be your reason yeah
Don't be afraid for what is to come
It's been too long since that bell was rung
Ooh yeah I'll be the reason
Why you should even have a little faith
Why you should grow and cultivate
I'll be your reason yeah
I found a place where the weekend's long (found a place)
Don't check no luggage just carry on (all night long)
Leave the sorrows indoctrinated
Cause now you've been emancipated
Say come on it couldn't be a sin
Maybe your god could see the heart of things
And I'll be your reason
Sometimes you need some time to play
You think you lost but you just found your way
Ooh yeah I'll be your reason
Come on now
I found a place where the weekend's long (found a place)
Don't check no luggage just carry on (all night long)
Leave your sorrows indoctrinated
Cause now you've been emancipated
What you believe in isn't what you thought
Oh my love I wouldn't break your heart
I'll be your reason whoa
Pick you up at four four five
Keeping hope and dream alive
Ooh yes I'll be your reason yeah

Welcome to the world I cant promise it's a good place
Welcome to the world I cant promise it's a cool place
I could tell you stories I tell you the truth
I could sugar coat it try to make you the fool
And soon you'll see anyway that this is life
And soon you'll see anyway that you got to fight
[Chorus]
I could give you roses for you to make your bed
But this bed of roses is only in your head
Cause every rose has its thorn
And every ego has its wants
I don't know when innocence is lost
And I don't know when you pay the cost
Well if your back is against the wall
You've got to stand for who you are
[Chorus]
People are suffering children have no food
Keep your eyes wide open check the golden rule
The love inside will make you cry
The fight inside will make you try

Homeless man

Don't try to hide it
'Cause I can see it all
In your face yeah
It the same questions
That I ask myself every time
To be or not to be
[Chorus: x3]
Do you wanna be
A well fed slave or a hungry free man
What is the point in being free
When you can't get no job
What is the point in being free
When you can't get food
What is the point in going out to work
When others can get for free
What is the point in being free
When you don't have no home
Now you've heard it all
It is time to make up
Your own mind
To be or not to be
Oh ho ho ho
[Chorus:]
Do you wanna be
A well fed slave or a hungry free man

Body of a goddess slash con artist

Graduated from street college

She's a business slash entrepreneur when she's shaking that

When she move them hips and makin' them wine
Make you feel like a king for one night
Set you up on a lick and rob you blind

Half Jamaican, the other half Cuban

When the lights gone out and the food run out
All we have is just the music

If you don't have good music
Then you don't have a chance

Be wise, be free when you're young
When you're young
Well, someone told me, not long ago now
You're only young but for once
It's the one time in a lifetime
There is no second chance, second chance
So when you're young
Hold your head high and hold on to your dreams
There's a world waiting out there
Not always what it seems
Be wise, be free when you're young
When you're young
It's said, you got your freedom to make your own rules
Be nobody's footstool
And you may try now to change the world too
But don't let it change you, it can't change you
So when you're young
Hold your head high and hold on to your dreams
There's a world waiting out there
Not always what it seems
When you're young
When you're young
You see that many a people in my time of mend
Telling tales of regret
Step aside Grandma, step aside Grandpa
There are somethings I must get, I must get
When you're young
Hold your head high and hold on to your dreams
There's a world waiting out there
Not always what it seems
When you're young
When you're young
You know it's the right time
You know it's the right time
Said, I know
(When you're young)
Said, I know
(When you're young)
When you're young
When you're young

Man to man is so unjust, children:
Ya don't know who to trust.
Your worst enemy could be your best friend,
And your best friend your worse enemy.
Some will eat and drink with you,
Then behind them su-su 'pon you.
Only your friend know your secrets,
So only he could reveal it.
And who the cap fit, let them wear it!
Who the cap fit, let them wear it!
Said I throw me corn, me no call no fowl;
I saying, "Cook-cook-cook, cluk-cluk-cluk."
Some will hate you, pretend they love you now,
Then behind they try to eliminate you.
But who Jah bless, no one curse;
Thank God, we're past the worse.
Hypocrites and parasites
Will come up and take a bite.
And if your night should turn to day,
A lot of people would run away.
And who the stock fit let them wear it!
Who the (cap fit) let them (wear it)!
And then a-gonna throw me corn,
And then a-gonna call no fowl,
And then a-gonna "Cook-cook-cook, cluk-cluk-cluk."

Or get burnt within the fire, that's not my desire
Who will be there
Hey could you tell me who
Who will be there
Who will be there
Hey could you tell me who

So pack your bags, let's be on our way

We got to move out within the morrow
A question giving them horror
Who will be there

Why must I live this life alone?
Why must I live this life alone? Yes
Everyone is having fun but I am having none
What in this world can I do? Yeah
I tried the best I can to let them understand
That I'm only a man, yes
But I can't seem to find someone with peace of mind
Someone who's true and kind
Why must I live this life alone?

A fire burns for freedom
A fire burns for freedom
The smell of decent is I
I am standing for the truth
Too long has been denied
The data of changing is rising
I hope we realize
Unchained wings let angels fly
[Chorus:]
I see hemp fields forever
Growing wild and free
I see marijuana trees blowing in our breeze
I see hemp fields forever growing wild and free
Wild and free
A crime against nations
A war is waged there is a message
In the wind for every race
Peace and love we saw
So let us grow is good for the body
Is good for the soul
[Chorus]
So lost the kiss of death
Deny the tree of life
Stand hypocrisy for so many lies
Corporation greed can only see small farmers survive by planting weed
[Chorus]
[Chorus]
Crucified savior to save your face
Demonized nature our saving grace
We got to put to good use
What the lord has gave
Fruits of the tree herbs of the fields
[Chorus]

Lies they sell cheaper than bread

Secretly the system programme the pain
In disguise of every day life problems...
We are living in a world so corrupt...
Yeah, I am living in this world so corrupt
You are living in a world so corrupt
There is a way which seems so right to men

So much war and poverty
While few enjoy prosperity
They say the world is spinning around

Every mickle make a muckle
If you know what I say
Don't be fooled by the fool

And they know what is in their mind
They're trying to prove instead of to find
Truth don't hide in no valley
Truth don't hide in no brook
Truth a hide in your heart
Woe onto them who cause iniquity
With chords of vanity, they call evil god
Put darkness for light; bitter for sweet
Woe unto dem who are wise
In their own eyes, what a life
Behind the scene eyes nuh see
What governments hide
C.I.A should D.O.A., K.G.B. should R.I.P.
That's what on my mind
The bible was changed to suit King James
Many empty lies, hear say, hear say, hear say
John public blind, public want to know the truth today
And the world became this way
Because the trick in the trade
They refuse to see it, save the people pray

You and your smiling face
Doesn't mean a thing, to me
Any man will pick you up
Just because of that smile you've got
But after knowing you as much as I
He's gonna leave you.. just like I did
The smile, you were smiling dear
Did excite me so much, that I had a feeling
I never had before
But after knowing you I had to run
Because it's only a smile you've got
The smile, you were smiling dear
Did excite me so much
That I.. had a feeling
I never had before
But after knowing you.. I had to run
Because it's only a smile you've got
Because it's only a smile you've got

You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
But you must try, try and try, try and try 
You'll succeed at last
Persecution you must fear
Win or lose you got to get your share
You've got your mind set on a dream
You can get it though hard it may seem now
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
But you must try, try and try, try and try 
You'll succeed at last
I know it - listen
Rome was not built in a day
Opposition will come your way
But the hotter the battle you see
Is the sweeter the victory now
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
You can get it if you really want
But you must try, try and try, try and try 
You'll succeed at last

First you came and you sold us Christianity
But all your members just lust after vanity
Telling them to trust in you faithfully
Not seeing it's the return of the slavery
Taught us of heaven way up in the sky
Where we can't reach unless we die
But you can't fool me again
You can't fool me again and again
You can't fool me again
You just can't fool me, no you can't fool me
Of things you taught me in school
There's so much to make me a fool
But if I was a mule
I know I'd be used as a tool
I said that, you can't fool me again
You can't fool me again, and again
You can't fool me again
You just can't fool me, you can't fool me
You draw and object on piece of a paper
Said I'm to serve it as lord and as savior
Tell me of a heaven way up in the sky
Where I can't reach unless I die
You can't fool me again
I said you can't fool me, you can't fool me
You can't fool me again
You just can't fool me, no you can't fool me
You said Humpty sat up on a wall
You say Humpty, he had a fall
You said that cow, jump over moon
And the dish ran away with the spoon
But I know you can't fool me again
You can't...

[Woman:]
I got lonely sometime
You were gone and left
Like you always do
You were never there
When I needed some care
You were never there when I needed somebody to talk to
Somebody came and took your place.
[Man:]
Oh! Baby
Somebody took my place
In your heart I can say
I'm used to it
By now, 'cause it happens all the time
That is one test I always fail
But one thing my heart can't
Understand... who's gonna take
The place of this boy in my heart
We used to play together,
Do everything together,
But now what am I gonna say
[Chorus:]
You've got no right
To call me father
I've got no right
To call you son,
You got no right to talk to me
I've got no right to talk to you
Even though I try so hard
To be strong, but it hurts inside.
[Woman:]
As I pack my bags
To go now baby I thought
I could share this with you
The next time you fall In love
Treat your woman right
Remember that her place
Is not only in the Kitchen
All she needs is tender
Loving care.
[Chorus: till fade]

There is no reason
To cry for you now
I needed you
When I was a little boy
But now I'm on my own
I tried to call you many times
Every time I tried in vain
[Chorus:]
You know where to find me
When you wanna see me
You know where to find me
When you wanna talk to me
Tears could not bring you back
I've told myself I'm an orphan
The only consolation I had was
I'm not the only one
[Chorus]
Everywhere you've been
You'd leave women crying after you
I have brothers somewhere
In this world
But I don't know them
I have sisters somewhere
In this world
But I don't  know them
[Chorus]

I saw you coming to meet me
With all your friends coming to greet me
It is a good communication
It's a heavy, heavy, heavy, vibration
You make me feel so good inside
Yes, you make me feel so good inside
And the first I saw your face
And I want to know, what's your name
Yes, you know who I am
And I want to know who you are
Yes, you know who I am
And I want to know who you are
Yes, you know who I am
And I want to know who you are
It is nice, meeting all of you
And to talk with you, you see what love can do
What a sweet communication
With a heavy, heavy, heavy, vibration
And you make me feel so good inside
Yes, you make me feel so good inside
And the first I saw your face
And I want to know, what's your name
'Cause you know who I am
And I want to know who you are
Yes, you know who I am
And I want to know who you are
Yes, you know who I am
And I want to know who you are
Want to know who you are
I saw you coming to meet me
With all your friends coming to greet me
It is a good communication
It's a heavy, heavy, heavy, vibration
And you make me feel so good inside
Yes, you make me feel so good inside
And the first I saw your face
And I want to know, what's your name
'Cause you know who I am
And I want to know who you are
Yes, you know who I am
And I want to know who you are
Yes, you know who I am
And I want to know who you are
Want to know who you are, yeah
You know who I am
And I want to know, I want to know
Who you are
You know who I am
And I want to know who you are
Yes, you know who I am
And I want to know

You left me standing by the door
You left me standing by the door
I know troubles won't last too long
But give me the strength and courage
To carry on
You left me standing by the door
That was yesterday
You left me standing by the door
Farewell, you bid me in the prison
But a light shone through
Showing me a new horizon
Pain is just a stimulant to make you grow
So I made it through and I think you should know
You left me standing by the door
That was yesterday
You left me standing by the door
I know troubles won't last too long
God give me the strength and courage
To carry on
You left me standing by the door
You left me standing by the door
I was unaware of the chains that had me bound
While you were excited 'bout the new life that was found
I prayed for guidance from above
'Cause I've been forgotten and no one to show me love
You left me standing by the door
You left me standing by the door

Liar, liar, your pants are on fire
You've got a nose as long as a telephone wire
I swear to tell the truth
Nothing but the truth
So help me God
I cross my heart and hope to die
These are the words we use
To get out of situations
Then I wonder why
We don't mean what we say
Then I remembered the terrible truth
About the truth
[Chorus:]
If you stand for the truth
You will always stand alone
The holy book tells us
The truth will set us free
But in this world I know different
Do you believe in the truth
Do you believe in righteousness
Do you believe in innocent
Till proven guilty
'Cause those that tell the truth
Are always on the run... Oh God
Then I wonder why
We don't mean what we say
Then I remembered the terrible truth
About the truth
[Chorus]

Which way from here
I'm caught up in the pages of my mind
And it's not so clear
But it seems the hurt is way too much this time
Cause I see a vaine look in your eyes
Tell me, do you see the same, same look in mine
Sandpapper kisses, papercut bliss
Don't know what this is, but it all leads to this
You're gonna leave, her
You have deceived, her
Ooh just a girl
Now here I go again
She said I'll break her heart again
She plays the fool again
She said I'll break the rules again
Though I disagree
She thinks she knows me more than me
It's so hard to see
What this voice keeps telling me
Ooh just a girl with featherweight curls
To expose all she knows you play like tease
Just a Girl with featherweight curls
To expose all she knows you play like tease
You're gonna leave, her
You have decieved, her
Ooh just a girl

You're my Yoko,
You're my Yoko Ono
You're my beauty queen
You're my fashion scene
Baby be my muse
I'm the one to choose
Take me on that ride
Wave the milky way goodbye
You give me good vibration
Oh you're sweet inspiration
Ya my Yoko,
Ya my Yoko Ono
Ya my Yoko,
Ya my Yoko Ono
You're my love machine
End the wars and find the peace
Making love wrapped in the sheets
While those preachers they preach
The art of life we lead
So the freedom that we feel
Together we will stay
When will the world see things our way
Ya my Yoko,
Ya my Yoko Ono
Ya my Yoko,
Ya my Yoko Ono
The Boys will be sad
Remembering the good times that we had
The girls will be mad
(Ziggy we don't have what we used to have)
When it's time to groove
Can't be waiting on tomorrow, Oh no
So let the music play
(Hey we'll find ourselves in the melody)
Ya my Yoko,
Ya my Yoko Ono
Ya my Yoko,
Ya my Yoko Ono
Ya my Yoko,
Ya my Yoko Ono
Ya my Yoko,
Ya my Yoko Ono

You're the only one
Whom I can trust
You're the only one
To believe in
You're the only one
Whom I can trust
You're the only one
To believe in
Oh I've seen
Lots of real fine dancers
Ones who can move you on the floor
Oh they talk
But they have no answers
When it gets right down to the core
Baby, you're the only one
Whom I can trust
You're the only one
To believe in
You're the only one
Whom I can trust
You're the only one
To believe in
Oh I've been to historic places
Showered with their charms and their graces
When it comes down to being me
Just me
Just happy
Just free
Baby, you're the only one
Whom I can trust
You're the only one
To believe in
You're the only one
Whom I can trust
You're the only one
To believe in

Hmm mmm mmm, yeah)
Yeah
You're the only one
Whom I can trust
You're the only one
To believe in
You're the only one
Whom I can trust
You're the only one
To believe in
You're the only, only one
Whom I can trust
You're the only one
You're the only one
To believe in
Yes you are
You're the only, only one
Whom I can trust
Only one, only one
To believe in
You're the only one
Whom I can trust, yeah
You're the only one
To believe in

I still believe in a little bit of magic
Even though the world has gone crazy
So good to know we still have a friend
You came to me last night
And whispered in my ear
Told me not to worry
About anything yeah
You said you are still my friend
And the feeling is natural
Right here 
Thabo Thabo my friend Thabo
Thabo Thabo your friend Thabo [x2]
Thabo Thabo our friend Thabo
I believe......
[Chorus:]
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend
Don't have to worry no more
Go! Go! Tabo [x2]
Your fears will be my fears
Your dreams will be my dreams too
Even your joys will be my joys too
'Cause a friend in need 
Is a friend indeed 
I love Thabo 
You love Thabo
Thabo we love you
Go! Go! Go! Thabo 
[Chorus:]
You've got a friend
Don't have to worry no more

I lost at love before
Got mad and I closed the door
But you said try just once more
I chose you for the one
Now I'm having so much fun
You treated me so kind
I'm about to lose my mind
You made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life
The others were untrue
But when it came to lovin' you
I'd spend my whole life with you
Cause you came and you took control
You touched my very soul
You always showed me that
Loving you was where it's at
You made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life
I love you so much, it seems
That you're even in my dreams
I hear you calling me
I'm so in love with you
All I ever want to do is
Thank you, baby
You made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life
You made me so very happy
I'm so glad you came into my life

When my heart was lonely, into pieces
I went looking with the sunshine, on the beaches
All my riches, couldn't save I if I needed
Love was so close to I, Yes I was mystified
There was so much more, I need to know
Whoa, oh
Like a lost memory
I found you
I found you
I found you
And I found you
And I found you, yeah
The waves crashed into me,
Like a ship at sea
I was caught in a hurricane,
Faced with my own regrets, I took a breath
While waiting for angels who've lost their way
I found you
I found you
I found you
I found you
There I found you
Takes the salt from my face
Put some honey in my tea, yes
Cause it's the love I didn't see
That loves the most
I found you
I found you
I found you
And I found you
I found you
I found you
I found you
Yeah, I found you
And I found you
And I found you
Planted the seeds, now it grows
Open the windows to my soul
Now the other half can be told
Like a lost history
You, You, You
And I found you, yeah
